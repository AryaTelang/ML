The availability of social media platforms for communication provides a valu-\\nable source of information for sentiment analysis and opinion mining research. The content shared across\\nthe media gives potential input to the physical environment and social phenomena related to publicsecurity threats. The input has been used to: monitor public security threats or emergency events, ana-\\nlyzing sentiment and opinionated data for threat management and the detection of public security threat\\nevents using geographic location-based sentiment analysis. However, a systematic survey that describesthe trends and latest developments in this domain is unavailable. This paper presents a survey of socialmedia sentiment analysis and opinion mining for public security. This paper aims to: understand the pro-\\ngress of the current state-of-the-art, identify the research gaps, and propose potential future directions. In\\ntotal, 200 articles published from 2016 to 2023 were considered in this survey. The taxonomy shows thekey attributes and limitations of the work presented in the surveyed articles. Subsequently, the potential\\nfuture direction of work on sentiment analysis in the public security domain is suggested for interested\\nresearchers./C2112023 The Author(s).

Introduction\\nEnsuring public security has long been a core factor of a stable\\ncountry. Over time, the deﬁnition of security has broadened to\\nencompass a range of sectors and domains, including environ-\\nmental, societal, economic, and political. Additionally, the con-\\ncept of security has deepened to include individual safety and\\nwell-being, not just national or state-level security ( Stevens and\\nVaughan-Williams, 2016 ). According to the Oxford dictionary,\\nsecurity encompasses the activities involved in protecting a\\ncountry, building, or person agai nst attack and danger, as well\\nas the state of feeling happy and safe from danger or worry\\n(Hornby and Cowie, 1995 ). In general, public security consists\\nof: maintaining social privacy, el iminating risks, and the optimal\\nuse of opportunities to ensure sustainable development andwell-being ( Dehdezi and Sardi, 2016 ). The common deﬁnition\\nof public security is the protect ion and safety of persons or prop-\\nerty against the threat of attack and danger ( Manunta, 1999;\\nOrtmeier, 1998 ). The threat concerns can be criminal or non-\\ncriminal. Criminal threats typical ly arise from non-natural causes\\nsuch as terrorism, riots, protests, crises, conﬂicts, accidents and\\ncrime. Non-criminal threats, on the other hand, are caused by\\nnatural events such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks and\\npandemics. Ensuring public secu rity is vital for protecting the\\ngeneral public: from signiﬁcant threats, danger, injury, harm,\\ndamage and/or loss of life; whether caused by natural or non-\\nnatural events ( Bansal et al., 2021; Chung and Zeng, 2018;\\nOrtmeier, 1998 ). These events have seriously threatened human\\nlife and safety for a considerable time, causing signiﬁcant eco-\\nnomic and cultural loss.Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, is the ﬁeld of\\nstudy that analyzes people’s opinions, sentiments, appraisals, atti-\\ntudes, and emotions toward entities and their attributes expressed\\nin written text. Although the terms ‘‘opinion” and ‘‘sentiment” are\\nrelated, there is a subtle difference between them. Opinion mining\\nprimarily deals with a person’s concrete view of something, while\\nsentiment refers to an attitude or thought prompted by a feeling.\\nOpinion mining involves two levels of abstraction: a single opinion\\nand a set of opinions, whereas sentiment analysis mainly focuses\\non opinions that express or imply positive or negative sentiment\\n(Liu, 2020 ). However, the terms ‘‘sentiment analysis” and ‘‘opinion\\nmining” are used interchangeably as an umbrella for different\\ntasks, such as opinion extraction, sentiment mining, subjectivity\\nanalysis, effect analysis, review mining, entity extraction and emo-\\ntion analysis ( Bhatia et al., 2020 ;Gupta and Agrawal, 2020; Pang\\nand Lee, 2008 ).\\nSentiment analysis and opinion mining were initially used for\\nproduct review applications but have recently shifted to other\\ntasks, including: stock markets, elections, disasters, healthcare\\nand software engineering ( Mäntylä et al., 2018 ). In the context of\\npublic security, sentiment analysis and opinion mining have been\\nused to analyze sentiment and public opinion, of an event or disas-\\nter, so as to trigger warnings to the public. More generally, senti-\\nment analysis can be said to comprise the analysis of the\\nsentiment, emotions, opinions and attitudes expressed by individ-\\nuals towards events, phenomena and particular crises. Due to the\\navailability of social media data and the huge amount of sentiment\\nand opinionated data it contains, sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmining have been used in a wide range of domains, such as busi-\\nness, marketing, entertainment, hospitality, politics, social issues,M.S.

The techniques used have been employed\\nnot only by organizations and individuals but also by local and fed-\\neral governments. The occurrence of events is typically accompa-\\nnied by public opinion on social media, which serves as a\\nmedium for disseminating or expressing sentiment. The content\\nshared across social media platforms provides a valuable source\\nof knowledge about the physical environment and social phenom-\\nena ( Alfarrarjeh et al., 2017 ). The availability of textual data from\\nsocial media platforms has encouraged research on sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining. As a result, the public security\\ndomain has become an important application domain in sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining.\\nResearchers have leveraged sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmining to achieve a range of purposes. For example, there is much\\nreported work that utilizes sentiment analysis and opinion miningdirected at social media, to analyze public security threats. This\\nincludes the analysis of social media data that expresses opinions\\nand/or sentiment for the monitoring of public security threats\\nand emergency events, as well as the prediction or detection of\\nevents from social media acquired data using sentiment analysis.\\nAdditionally, researchers have employed geographic location-\\nbased sentiment analysis for the detection of public security\\nthreats or emergency events ( Sattaru et al., 2021 ).\\nSeveral literature reviews and survey papers for sentiment anal-\\nysis and opinion mining directed at the public security domain\\nhave been published. de Carvalho and Seixas Costa (2021) provided\\na comprehensive review of social web mining and sentiment anal-\\nysis in public security and proposed a research agenda for future\\nwork. Boukabous and Azizi (2020) reviewed the latest trends in\\nlearning-based sentiment analysis techniques for security intelli-\\ngence purposes, with a focus on cybersecurity, security attacks,\\ncrimes, extremism, disasters and hate speech. They suggested a\\nfuture research direction to consider combining learning-based\\nsecurity for sentiment analysis. Meanwhile, Sharma and Jain\\n(2020) surveyed the sentiment analysis approaches and techniques\\nfor social media security and analytics, covering various security\\ndomains such as deception detection, anomaly detection, risk man-\\nagement, and disaster relief. Finally, Razali et al. (2021) examined\\nthe literature on opinion mining in multiple domains based on\\ntext, and highlighting the potential of the Kansei approach in\\nnational security research. However, these papers did not provide\\na descriptive taxonomy of sentiment analysis and opinion mining\\nin the public security domain. A taxonomy categorizes previous\\nwork based on speciﬁed attributes that could help stakeholders\\nto better comprehend the issues involved. Therefore, this survey\\npaper aims to ﬁll this gap by categorizing relevant work, and devel-\\noping a taxonomy based on the most recent research on sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining for public security. Additionally, thispaper provides an overview and analysis of current trends in sen-\\ntiment analysis and opinion mining in public security, an overview\\nand analysis not included in previous surveys and studies directed\\nat the topic. Finally, the paper discusses the current issues and\\nfuture directions of sentiment analysis and opinion mining in the\\npublic security domain.\\nThis survey paper has three primary objectives: (1) to develop a\\ntaxonomy of the current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis and\\nopinion mining techniques speciﬁcally applicable to the public\\nsecurity domain; (2) to visualize and analyze recent trends in the\\nﬁeld; and (3) to identify any remaining issues and suggest poten-\\ntial future research directions. The structure of the paper is as fol-\\nlows: Section 2 outlines the methodology used to conduct this\\nsurvey, Section 3 provides an overview of sentiment analysis and\\nopinion mining in the context of public security, Section 4 presents\\nthe developed taxonomy and provides detailed explanations of\\neach sub-branch within it, Section 5 analyzes trends, research gaps,\\nand remaining issues in the ﬁeld, and suggests potential futuredirections for sentiment analysis and opinion mining in public\\nsecurity. Section 6 discusses the critical area reﬂected to the issues\\nand future direction based on authors’ opinions and ﬁnally, Sec-\\ntion 7 concludes the paper.\\n2. Methodology\\nIn this section, the methodology used to conduct the survey of\\nrecent work directed at sentiment analysis and opinion mining\\nfor public security is described. Fig. 1 shows the methodology used.\\nFirst, several relevant databases of peer-reviewed articles were\\nidentiﬁed. The Scopus\\n1, IEEE Xplore2, and Science Direct3databases\\nwere selected due to their wide coverage of scientiﬁc peer-reviewed\\narticles and strict evaluations of the journals indexed in their data-\\nbases. A set of relevant keywords were used to search for all possible\\narticles related to sentiment analysis and opinion mining in public\\nsecurity. Various combinations of terms and operators were used,\\nincluding ‘‘sentiment AND analysis AND public AND security\", ‘‘opin-\\nion AND mining AND public AND security\", ‘‘sentiment AND analysis\\nAND public AND threat\", ‘‘opinion AND mining AND public AND\\nthreat\", ‘‘sentiment AND analysis AND public AND disaster\", ‘‘opin-ion AND mining AND public AND disaster\", ‘‘sentiment AND analysis\\nAND public AND event\", and ‘‘opinion AND mining AND public AND\\nevent”. The search yielded a total of 2097 articles in Scopus, 669 in\\nIEEE Xplore, and 239 in Science Direct.\\nSecond, a screening process of the articles found for each data-\\nbase was conducted. The non-academic articles were removed. The\\narticles that remained consist of journals, conference proceedings\\nand serials. Duplication of articles found in each of the selected\\ndatabases was also removed. To ensure only the state-of-the-art\\nwork was considered in this paper, only articles published in\\nrecent years (2016–2023) were included. After the screening, the\\nremaining number of articles were Scopus: 1903, IEEE Xplore:\\n663, and Science Direct: 166.\\nThird, we performed the eligibility ﬁltering process, which\\ninvolved two sub-processes: (i) the combination of the databases\\nand removal of duplicates across the database, and (ii) a brief\\nreview of the articles. After removing duplicates, the number of\\narticles was reduced to 1485. Then, we manually reviewed the\\ntitles, abstracts, and keywords of each article to identify works that\\nemployed sentiment analysis/opinion mining in the public security\\ndomain and were written in English. Based on these criteria, we\\nselected a total of 280 articles. We conducted a thorough review\\nof the content of these articles and found 200 articles to be eligible\\nfor inclusion in this paper.\\n3. An overview of sentiment analysis and opinion mining for\\npublic security\\nThis section provides an overview of opinion mining and senti-\\nment analysis in the context of public security. The overview is\\nbased on the general framework found in the majority of the arti-\\ncles. Fig. 2 shows the general framework typically adopted when\\nconducting sentiment analysis and opinion mining in the public\\nsecurity domain.\\nAs noted in the introduction to this paper, the aim of sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining is to analyze written text to identify\\nsentiments, opinions, attitudes, emotions, and appraisals toward\\nentities and their attributes.

The initial step in conducting sentiment analysis\\nand opinion mining is to acquire a dataset of text from a social\\nmedia platform or other relevant sources using keywords, geo-\\ngraphic location information, or speciﬁc timeframes based on the\\nobjectives of the research. In some cases, publicly shared datasets\\nmay be used, which eliminates the need for data acquisition. For\\nlanguage-focused events, the relevant social media platform is\\nused to provide insight into the true sentiment of the event.\\nThe acquired dataset undergoes pre-processing using text-\\nprocessing techniques to transform the raw data into a suitableform. Various approaches such as machine learning-based, lexiconor rule-based, hybrid, or manual coding can be used, depending on\\nthe preference of the researcher. However, supervised and semi-\\nsupervised machine learning require a data annotation step for\\ndata labeling before pre-processing. This pre-processing stage is\\nrequired to remove noise and irrelevant data in preparation for\\nthe feature engineering stage ( Liu, 2020 ). Pre-processing tech-\\nniques commonly used include text cleaning, normalization\\n(Wadawadagi and Pagi, 2021 ;Zhang and Cheng, 2021 ), replace-\\nment ( Geeta, 2016 ), and stopword removal ( Mohamed Ridhwan\\nand Hargreaves, 2021 ).\\nAfter pre-processing, the next step is feature engineering, which\\ninvolves feature extraction, selection, and representation ( Eke\\net al., 2020 ).

The extracted features represent the original text in a mean-\\ningful form, typically numerical, that is compatible with the algo-\\nrithms used Kulkarni and Shivananda (2019) . The techniques\\nused to extract features include statistical, Natural Language Pro-\\ncessing (NLP), or rule-based techniques. Deep learning has also\\nbeen proposed as a feature engineering method, which can learn\\nmultiple levels of representation from raw data and reduce the\\neffort required for feature extraction and selection ( Bhatia et al.,\\n2020 ).\\nAfter the feature engineering stage, sentiment or opinion classi-\\nﬁcation can be performed. This is typically conducted using some\\nform of classiﬁcation algorithm often founded on a lexicon of some\\nkind. In the lexicon-based approach, sentiment classiﬁcation is\\nbased on sentiment resources, such as a lexicon or a corpus data-\\nbase. Usually, as a result of the classiﬁcation, a sentiment score iscalculated and evaluated according to the associated sentiment\\norientation and strength ( Pang and Lee, 2008 ). Other approaches\\nuse topic modeling to categorize the topics within the dataset\\n(Lee and Nerghes, 2017 ). The system’s performance, using test\\ndata, is typically recorded for evaluation purposes.\\nThe evaluation of system performance entails a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of several key measures. The evaluation metrics used\\ncan be categorized based on the approach adopted for analysis.\\nMachine learning-based approaches frequently adopt metrics such\\nas accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measures. Accuracy is the pro-\\nportion of total predictions that were correctly identiﬁed, encom-\\npassing both positive and negative sentiments. Precision, on the\\nother hand, indicates the proportion of positive identiﬁcations that\\nwere actually correct. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the propor-\\ntion of actual positives that were correctly identiﬁed. The F1-\\nmeasure provides a balance between precision and recall. The per-\\nformance measures for lexicon approach usually adopt accuracy\\nbased on sentiment score calculation, determined based on the indi-\\nvidual sentiment scores of the words or phrases in the text. These\\nsentiment scores are typically derived from a pre-compiled senti-\\nment lexicon, where each word or phrase is associated with a senti-\\nment score ( Fan et al., 2020; Thorat and Namrata Mahender, 2019 ).\\nFinally, the resulting sentiment analysis is used to provide\\ninsight into the event of interest, either by predicting future occur-\\nrences or by providing a retrospective analysis of the event.4. The taxonomy for sentiment analysis and opinion mining for\\npublic security\\nIn this section, a taxonomy of the recent work directed at senti-\\nment analysis and opinion mining, derived from the overview dis-\\ncussed in Section 3 , is presented. The aim of the taxonomy was to\\nsummarize and provide a clear picture of the main concepts\\nexpressed, and similarities between the recent works. Seven attri-\\nbutes were identiﬁed for inclusion in the taxonomy, represented\\nusing the oval shape in Fig. 3 . These attributes were chosen as they\\nwere consistent across all articles surveyed. The seven attributesare: (1) objectives of the work conducted, (2) the domain of public\\nsecurity, (3) the public security event timeframe, (4) the social\\nmedia platform used for data acquisition, (5) dataset type, (6) the\\nlanguage of the dataset, and (7) the sentiment analysis or opinion\\nmining approach employed. Sections 4.1–4.7 provide a detailed\\ndescription of each attribute and a survey of relevant works in that\\narea.\\n4.1. Objective of sentiment analysis and opinion mining for public\\nsecurity\\nIn this survey, the ﬁrst attribute of the taxonomy is the catego-\\nrization of recent work based on their objectives, as shown in\\nTable 1 . The identiﬁcation of the objective is necessary for under-\\nstanding the issues addressed and the proposing of potential solu-\\ntions. It was found that most of the previous work focused on a\\nspeciﬁc task of sentiment analysis in public security threats,\\nalthough some work did consider several tasks. The taxonomy cat-\\negorized the recent works’ objectives into four groups: (1) analysis\\nof events, (2) improvement of techniques, (3) corpus generation,\\nand (4) multipurpose. Analysis of events refers to work in which\\nthe sentiment analysis or opinion mining was applied to a speciﬁc\\nevent in order to either: gain insight into the event and mine\\nrelated information, or analyze the event in order to support disas-\\nter and emergency management. The technique improvement\\nobjective refers to efforts to improve the performance of sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining frameworks in general. It can be fur-\\nther divided into feature engineering, classiﬁcation, or event pre-\\ndiction techniques. Corpus generation objective describes work\\nFig. 3.

In the analysis of speciﬁc event groups, most\\nwork was found to focus on analyzing: natural disasters, war and\\nterrorist activity, crime and chaos. Other analyses included: immi-\\ngrant and refugee, energy/ nuclear activity, infrastructure and eco-\\nnomic threat. The main output of this group was an analytical\\nstudy that measures and analyzes the sentiment or opinion of\\nthe public towards a certain event. It typically included an in-\\ndepth analysis to better understand: the severity level and demo-\\ngraphics ( Al-Agha and Abu-Dahrooj, 2019; Chandra et al., 2020 ;\\nZhang et al., 2021 ), public behaviors and responses ( Chung and\\nZeng, 2016; Gascó et al., 2017; Kostakos et al., 2018 ), temporal sen-\\ntiment analysis ( Chaudhary and Bansal, 2021; Kovács et al., 2021;\\nYu et al., 2021 ), event scenarios ( Gu et al., 2021; Lian et al., 2020 ),\\nand sentiment distribution and visualization ( Wang et al., 2016 ;\\nWu and Lu, 2017; Xiong et al., 2020 ).\\nIn the analysis of the disease outbreak and pandemic group, the\\naim was to analyze diseases and pandemics that threatened the\\npublic, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Zika\\nvirus, multiple diseases, monkeypox, and recent Coronavirus\\n(COVID-19). The objectives included sentiment analysis and topic\\nmodeling of COVID-19. Unlike the ﬁrst group described in the fore-\\ngoing paragraph, this group only focused on analyzing pandemics\\nor disease outbreaks. Thus, the output of this group was an analyt-\\nical study of an outbreak or pandemic that included outbreak iden-\\ntiﬁcation ( Yu et al., 2020 ;Zhao et al., 2022 ), tracking the pandemic\\n(Arias et al., 2022; Fakhry et al., 2020 ), and statistical analysis dur-\\ning a pandemic ( Ghanem et al., 2021 ;Zhang et al., 2021 ).\\nFor the disaster or emergency management group, some of the\\nwork considered focused on improving disaster management and\\nexploring emergency management of speciﬁc events. The output\\nof this group was typically an analysis of emergency and disaster\\nevents that might include: a sentiment and disaster concern index\\n(Bai and Yu, 2016 ), an event urgency level ( Chen and Ji, 2021;\\nSubramaniyaswamy et al., 2017 ), a quantitative analysis of public\\nresilience during emergency events ( Fan et al., 2020 ;Li et al.,\\n2020; Zhang et al., 2020 ), and decision support systems for\\nimproving disaster management ( Behl et al., 2021; Obiedat et al.,\\n2021; Xu et al., 2017 ).\\n4.1.2. Improvement of techniques\\nThe second objective of recent work that was found was to\\nimprove the techniques used for sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmining systems. Proposed improvements have focused on three\\nmain areas: (i) feature engineering, (ii) classiﬁcation improvement,\\nand (iii) event prediction. Table 1 lists the work considered related\\nto these technique improvements. Each is described in the follow-\\ning paragraphs.\\nFor feature engineering improvement, the surveyed work\\ntended to be focused on feature enhancement and representation\\ntechniques. In this context, features refer to input variables or attri-\\nbutes derived from distinct raw data ( Guyon et al., 2008 ). The goal\\nof improving features is to ﬁnd a good representation of data rele-\\nvant to a speciﬁc domain and associated measurement. The sur-\\nveyed work identiﬁed two potential means for enhancing\\nfeatures: information enrichment and expansion of lexicon. For\\nthe information enrichment, all relevant work considered geo-\\ngraphical and location information from harvested social media\\ndata. Speciﬁcally, proposed approaches included: the development\\nof geographical sentiment models, exploration of spatio-temporal\\nfactors, geographical sentiment analysis with topic modeling and\\nframework for analyzing social media using geographic locations\\nduring disasters. The objective of lexicon expansion, on the other\\nhand, is more focused on improving the vocabulary and dictionary\\nto tackle the rapid evolution of language. This particular task pre-\\nsents greater challenges, resulting in a comparatively lower distri-\\nbution for this objective. The output for this group tended to be amethodology for sentiment or opinion analysis from a geographiclocation perspective, including geographic location-based senti-\\nment models ( Dahal et al., 2019; Fakhry et al., 2020 ;Yue et al.,\\n2018 ), and spatio-temporal approaches for sentiment analysis in\\nthe public security domain ( Dahal et al., 2019; Karami et al.,\\n2020 ;Zhang and Cheng, 2021 ).\\nRegarding lexicon expansion, the aim here was to enrich or\\nenlarge the lexicon to improve sentiment analysis performance.\\nA sentiment dictionary was built to address the shortage of sen-\\ntiment analysis on hot events in social media. Improvement of\\nshort text classiﬁcation using d omain sentiment lexicon expan-\\nsion with sentiment orientation analysis also has been experi-\\nmented. In addition, an emoji lexicon was developed for\\nsentiment polarity sign and intensity scores. Other work has been\\ndirected at generating corpora based on the domain or languageused. The main outputs of this group include: feature combina-\\ntion sets derived from expanded lexicons ( Abid et al., 2017; Bai\\nand Yu, 2016 ;Li and Wang, 2021 ), features sets based on the lan-\\nguage used ( Anuratha et al., 2021; Fuadvy and Ibrahim, 2019;\\nLaudy et al., 2017 ), lexical and semantic feature combinations\\nfor deep learning ( Li et al., 2021 ), multi-feature based deep learn-\\ning frameworks for classiﬁcation ( Sun et al., 2022 ) and textual\\nfeature sets based on disaster visual content ( Amin et al., 2021;\\nSadiq et al., 2020 ).\\nFor the improvement of classiﬁcation techniques, most of the\\nsurveyed work was focused on the modiﬁcation of the classiﬁers\\nused to generate the classiﬁcation models using machine learning,\\ndeep learning, and hybrid/ ensembles. Some other work has also\\ncontributed to the improving associated techniques for: annota-\\ntion, pipeline and parsing, utilization of lexicons for classiﬁcation,\\ntopic modeling, and multi-task or multi-level classiﬁcation. The\\noutput for this group was typically either: a technique or model\\n(Bansal et al., 2021; Bashar, 2022; Li et al., 2021 ), a framework\\n(Mendon et al., 2021; Thukral et al., 2021; Wahid et al., 2021 ),\\nand an algorithm of some kind ( Jiang et al., 2017; Moraes Silva\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020 ) for sentiment analysis or opinion\\nmining in public security domain.\\nFor the event prediction technique, the surveyed work focused\\non the improvement of the technique used to detect and predict an\\nevent according to their timeframe. Some of the objectives\\nincluded: the detection of an emergency event and early event\\ndetection, and real-time monitoring of the progress of an event.\\nThe ability to predict or detect events early can signiﬁcantly\\nenhance response times and potentially mitigate harm or damage.\\nThe output for this group tended to be an improved approach to\\nthe detection and prediction of an emergency/ disaster event\\nrelated to the public security domain before the event occurred\\n(An et al., 2021; Duan et al., 2020; Zhong, 2021 ).\\n4.1.3. Corpus generation\\nThe third objective was corpus generation, whereby a speciﬁc\\ncorpus or dataset related to the respective domain was produced.\\nThe generation was divided into initiation of the corpus and tech-\\nnique enhancement. The former created new corpus from scratch\\nor adding new data to an existing corpus while the latter reﬁned\\nand enhance existing technique to better curate data. The outputs\\nfrom this objective include: compiled corpora of texts concerning\\nspeciﬁc events related to public security ( Backfried and Shalunts,\\n2016; Effrosynidis et al., 2022; Thorat and Namrata Mahender,\\n2019 ), annotated corpora ( de Carvalho et al., 2020; Mamta,\\n2020 ), data collection methodology ( Abid et al., 2017 ) and dataset\\nmanipulation ( Olusegun et al., 2023 ).\\n4.1.4. Multipurpose\\nThe multipurpose objectives refer to work that addressed more\\nthan one issue concurrently, such as analysis of a speciﬁc event,M.S. Md Suhaimin, M.H. Ahmad Hijazi, E.G. Moung et al.

Based on the survey, the domain was\\ndivided into two: the natural and the non-natural security threat\\ndomains. Sub- sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 brieﬂy explain each group.\\n4.2.1. Natural\\nThe domain of natural events is deﬁned by the underlying nat-\\nural causes that trigger an event, which included natural disasters\\nand public health crises, as provided in Table 2 . Examples of the\\nnatural disaster events that have been studied include earthquake,\\nﬂood, wildﬁre, hurricane, storm, rainstorm, tornado, drought, tsu-\\nnami, climate change and blizzards. Examples of public health-\\nrelated events include: disease outbreaks such as Zika virus, mon-\\nkeypox and Avian inﬂuenza, epidemics and pandemics of COVID-\\n19. A few studies have also explored events that span multiple cat-\\negories. For example, the combination of earthquakes and the\\nSwine Inﬂuenza pandemic has been explored ( Li et al., 2017 ). Sim-\\nilarly, the joint occurrence of ﬂoods, earthquakes, and Inﬂuenza\\nspread have been studied ( Albayrak and Gray-Roncal, 2019 ).\\n4.2.2. Non-natural (human-made)\\nNon-natural events are those caused by humans or are human-\\nmade. This includes the following categories: emergencies, chaos,\\ncrises and cyber or technology threats, as provided in Table 3 .\\nThe emergency category includes energy-related incidents, nuclear\\naccidents, electricity/ power issues, transportation/ airlines inci-\\ndents, emergency trafﬁc issues, infrastructure collisions, crowd\\naccidents that triggered emergencies, water crises, and local public\\nemergency issues. The chaos category includes terrorism, riot, pro-\\ntest and crime. The crises category includes: conﬂicts between\\ncountries, immigrant issues and economic crises. The cyber and\\ntechnology threat category includes computer hacking, data pri-\\nvacy issues, and internet-related incidents. Mamta et al. (2020)\\nreported a study that encompassed multiple non-natural domains,\\nincluding terrorism, cyber-attacks, and crime. Recently, a review ofsentiment analysis in the context of public security was reported in\\n(de Carvalho and Seixas Costa, 2021 ) that concentrated on the con-\\nceptual framework of sentiment analysis for public emergency\\nevents.\\n4.3. Public security event timeframe\\nThe public security event timeframe refers to the time when the\\nsentiment analysis was used in any event related to public secu-\\nrity. The timeframe is divided into pre-event, during-event, and\\npost-event. Fig. 4 depicts the chronology of this timeframe. Sub-\\nsection 4.3.1 to 4.3.3 provide an explanation for each attribute.\\n4.3.1. Pre-event\\nThe pre-event timeframe covered sentiment analysis and opin-\\nion mining, related to natural and non-natural disasters or events,\\nprior to their occurrence. This timeframe has been the least\\nexplored in the literature. It holds signiﬁcant potential for enabling\\ngovernments and law enforcement agencies to remain vigilant\\nbased on predicted potential threats or unrest. The idea is to lever-\\nage previous and current datasets to analyze and predict events,\\nallowing for the implementation of necessary precautions or pre-\\nventive measures. For instance, Abid et al. (2017) proposed a\\nmethodology to extract, annotate, and unify suspicious social\\nmedia content to predict potential threats to public security. They\\nfocused on terrorism related to ISIS and Daesh using platforms\\nsuch as Twitter5, Facebook6and YouTube7. Similarly, Almehmadi\\net al. (2017) ) used Twitter public data to predict crime rates in Hous-\\nton and New York City. They collected offensive and non-offensive\\nTweets based on geographic location and analyzed the relationship\\nbetween tweet classiﬁcation and crime rates. Similar work, utilizing\\ngeolocation data and sentiment analysis was reported to monitor\\nand predict disasters in ( Albayrak and Gray-Roncal (2019); Suﬁ\\nand Khalil (2022) .\\n4.3.2. During-event\\nThe during-event timeframe is where sentiment analysis or\\nopinion mining is conducted in real-time during an ongoing event.\\nFrom the survey, the during-event timeframe is the second most\\ncommon area of study in social media sentiment analysis related\\nto public security. This approach is particularly useful for time-\\nsensitive issues with a large social media following, as it enablesTable 2\\nNatural domain’s event of related works.\\nDomain Natural disaster\\neventsRelated works\\nNatural\\ndisasterEarthquake Chen et al.

For instance, analyzing\\npublic sentiment during the 2011 Egyptian revolution in real-\\ntime provided more valuable insights than retrospective data from\\nprevious years. The amount of data acquired before any analysis\\ncan be performed is event-oriented. For example, an emergency\\nevent may necessitate the collection of social media data from\\nthe event’s inception through to the recovery period, while for dis-\\nasters such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, and tsunamis, the timespan\\ncould be shorter. In contrast, public health events, such as disease\\noutbreaks, require a longer time span for data collection. Once the\\ndata has been collected within the speciﬁed timeframe, it can be\\nanalyzed to support relief and disaster management efforts. Vari-\\nous studies have utilized the during-event timeframe to analyze\\nspeciﬁc events, such as disease outbreaks and the coronavirus pan-\\ndemic, as reported in ( Garcia and Berton, 2021; Koytak and Celik,\\n2022; Yu et al., 2021 ). Some reported work adopted a longer time-\\nframe, including data collected prior to the known occurrence of an\\nevent, to fully utilize available data for analysis ( Fakhry et al., 2020;\\nQuach et al., 2022 ;Zhao et al., 2022 ).\\n4.3.3. Post-event\\nBased on the survey, post-event sentiment analysis or opinion\\nmining is the most prevalent type of study in the ﬁeld of public\\nsecurity. This approach involves analyzing data after a speciﬁc\\nevent has occurred, either using the event date itself, or data from\\nan earlier time frame that triggered the public security threat. The\\npurpose of the analysis is usually to re-examine issues related to\\npublic security and provide insight into what happened ( Geeta,\\n2016; Li et al., 2016 ;Ma et al., 2016 ) and to prepare for future\\nendeavors ( Alfarrarjeh et al., 2017 ;Wang et al., 2016 ). The analysis\\nalso provides support for policy making ( Chung and Zeng, 2016; de\\nCarvalho and Costa, 2022 ) and management ( Gascó et al., 2017 ).\\nExamples of events analyzed using post-event sentiment analysis\\ninclude immigration and border security breaches ( Chung and\\nZeng, 2016 ), shooting incidents ( Wang et al., 2016 ), collision acci-\\ndents ( Li et al., 2016 ;Ma et al., 2016 ), nuclear accidents ( Li et al.,\\n2016 ), hurricane and earthquake disasters ( Alfarrarjeh et al., 2017 ).4.4. Social media platform\\nThe fourth attribute of the recent work on social media senti-\\nment analysis and opinion mining for public security was the plat-\\nform of social media used. The attribute can be grouped into those\\nusing a single social media platform and those using multiple plat-\\nforms mixed. Most of the recent work in the public security\\ndomain used a dataset from a single social media platform. From\\nthe survey, it was found that Twitter and Sina Weibo8were the\\nmost utilized, followed by YouTube, Facebook and other microblogs.\\nOnly a few instances of reported work used multiple platforms, or\\ncombined them with web feeds. There were examples of work thatcombined: Twitter, Facebook and web feeds ( Backfried and\\nShalunts, 2016 ), Twitter, Facebook and YouTube ( Ghanem et al.,\\n2021 ), Twitter and Flickr\\n9(Alfarrarjeh et al., 2017 ), Twitter and Red-\\ndit10(Qi et al., 2019 ), Twitter and ReliefWeb11(Li et al., 2017 ), Twit-\\nter and Sina Weibo ( Ma et al., 2020 ), Twitter/ Sina Weibo and online\\nnews feed ( de Carvalho and Costa, 2022; Xu et al., 2017 ;Yu et al.,\\n2020 ), and, Sina Weibo and WeChat12(Lian et al., 2020 ;Liu et al.,\\n2021 ).

It is argued that a combination of social media plat-\\nforms is required to improve sentiment analysis system performance\\nand present the actual sentiment or opinion of the public on a larger\\nscale ( Dahal et al., 2019; Mendon et al., 2021; Mohamed Ridhwan\\nand Hargreaves, 2021 ).\\n4.5. Dataset\\nThe ﬁfth attribute of the taxonomy pertains to the type of data-\\nset used in sentiment analysis and opinion mining for public secu-\\nrity. The dataset attribute can be grouped into two types: (i) public\\ndatasets, and (ii) private datasets. Public datasets, as the name sug-gests, are in the public domain. Public datasets are important\\nbecause they allow researchers to compare results. They are also\\nuseful with respect to transfer learning ( Anuratha et al., 2021;\\nBansal et al., 2021 ). However, due to the shortage of public data-\\nsets, the majority of the work conducted on sentiment analysis\\nand opinion mining has been conducted using private datasets.\\nFurthermore, researchers prefer to acquire their own private data-\\nset in order to achieve a speciﬁc objective or conduct an analysis\\nbased on a speciﬁc event.

Most of the public dataset available for\\nthe public health domain are COVID-19-related ( Banda et al.,\\n2021; Dimitrov et al., 2020 ;Kumar, 2020 ); (Lamsal, 2020a;\\nLamsal, 2020 ;Lyu et al., 2020; Pfeffer and Morstatter, 2016 ). Some\\nauthors have shared their dataset with the public. Examples\\ninclude: the refugee crisis ( Lee and Nerghes, 2017 ), the\\nPalestinian-Israeli conﬂict ( Al-Agha and Abu-Dahrooj, 2019 ), the\\nSewol Ferry Disaster ( Lee et al., 2020 ), terrorism and cyber security\\n(Mamta, 2020 ) and the Typhoon Haiyan disaster ( Zhang and\\nCheng, 2021 ). Recent efforts have also utilized public dataset for\\nmulti-domain purposes ( Mamta, 2020; Rudra et al., 2015 ).\\n4.6. Language\\nThe sixth attribute of the taxonomy pertains to the language of\\nthe dataset used. The language attribute can be grouped into three:\\n(i) monolingual, (ii) bilingual, and (iii) multilingual. A monolingual\\ndataset is composed of text in a single language, while a bilingual\\ndataset comprises two languages, and a multilingual dataset\\nincludes three or more languages. In terms of pre-processing and\\nfeature extraction support, with respect to the tools available and\\nthe source of the lexicon, monolingual has an advantage over the\\nothers. To fully exploit this beneﬁt, some reported work has\\nexcluded text in languages other than the preferred language, such\\nas keeping only English tweets and discarding others ( Almehmadi\\net al., 2017; Subramaniyaswamy et al., 2017 ). However, removing\\ndata in other languages may hamper the sentiment detection,\\nwhich could provide critical information about the disaster or\\nevents ( Li et al., 2016 ). The most common language used in the\\npublic security domain is English, followed by Chinese. Other lan-\\nguages include Indonesian, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Bangla,\\nTelugu, Vietnamese, German and Portuguese.\\nBilingual datasets typically comprise English combined with\\nanother language, such as Chinese, Filipino, Malay, Hindi, German,\\nPortuguese, and Spanish. In existing works, translation is often per-\\nformed from one language into another, such as translating written\\ntext in Filipino to English ( Zhang and Cheng, 2021 ) and Malay to\\nEnglish ( Azmi et al., 2022 ), before the sentiment analysis is con-\\nducted. Some reported work has combined a language with\\nanother translated language to maximize the available resources\\nfor representing features ( Fuadvy and Ibrahim, 2019 ). However,\\ncommunication that uses dual language presents a challenge in\\nbilingual datasets where different languages are compounded in\\na single sentence or comment ( Farzindar and Inkpen, 2020 ),\\nreferred to as ‘‘code-switched” or ‘‘code-mixed” data. This type of\\ndata presents a new research challenge in terms of ﬁltering the lan-guage, preprocessing, and feature representation, based on each\\nlanguage, while maintaining contextual meaning. Examples of\\nwork that uses code-mixed datasets are Malay with English\\n(Fuadvy and Ibrahim, 2019 ), Filipino with English ( Zhang and\\nCheng, 2021 ), Indonesian with English ( Yan et al., 2020 ), and Nige-\\nrian with English ( Adamu et al., 2021 ).\\nSentiment analysis and opinion mining for public security that\\nhave been conducted using multilanguage settings include combi-\\nnations of: English, French, and German ( Smith et al., 2018 ), Eng-\\nlish, Arabic, French, and German (\\nEl Ali et al., 2018 ), and English\\nin conjunction with other European languages ( Kovács et al.,\\n2021; Laudy et al., 2017 ). Additionally, there have been studies\\nthat utilized multilingual datasets from 218 countries worldwide\\n,(Imran et al., 2022 ). However, this reported work commonly used\\nseparate datasets for each language and generated separate models\\nbased on each dataset. In some countries, however, it was observed\\nthat multilingualism is used in a single dataset instead ( Suhaimin\\net al., 2017; Suhaimin et al., 2019 ).4.7. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining approach\\nThe seventh and last attribute of the taxonomy is the approach\\nused to perform sentiment analysis and opinion mining. It is criti-\\ncal to select an appropriate approach to achieve the objectives\\ndescribed in Section 4.3 and guide each methodology in complet-\\ning the analysis or mining. According to the taxonomy, the recent\\napproaches found in the surveyed work, in the public security\\ndomain, can be divided into machine learning-based, lexicon-\\napproaches, hybrid, and manual coding groups. Sub-section 4.7.1\\nto 4.7.4 present a detailed explanation of each group, and includes\\nsome surveyed works that have used each approach.\\n4.7.1. Machine learning-based\\nThe machine learning method is divided into ﬁve: (i) supervised\\nlearning, (ii) unsupervised learning, (iii) semi-supervised learning,\\n(iv) ensemble learning, and (v) deep learning. The following sub-\\nsection describes the details of each.\\ni Supervised learning\\nSupervised learning uses labeled data to learn and classify the\\nsentiment from opinionated text. It involves preprocessing textual\\ndata and extracting features ( Razali et al., 2021 ). The tasks include\\nthe removal of special characters and leaving only speciﬁc, mean-\\ningful words before features, such as Bag Of Words (BOW) and\\nWord2Vec features, are extracted. Recent work in the public secu-\\nrity domain has shown that supervised learning is the most popu-\\nlar approach. The algorithms that have been most frequently\\nemployed include: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Logistic\\nRegression (LR) and Maximum Entropy (ME). The researchers usu-\\nally experimented with multiple algorithms coupled with the\\nextracted features to ﬁnd the best performing classiﬁer Wang\\net al. (2016) .Bai and Yu (2016) showed that RF with a Distribution\\nRepresentation of Words (DRW) performed the best in the detec-\\ntion of messages related to disaster. Yue et al. (2018) found that\\nRF and SVM algorithms were the best in mapping different event\\ncorrelations with social media data. An et al. (2019) predicted\\nthe inﬂuence of social media in the context of terrorist events with\\nmultiple algorithms and concluded that LR algorithms produced\\nthe best prediction model. The work presented in ( Fakhry et al.,\\n2020 ) evaluated COVID-19 cases using social media data and its\\ngeographic location, and found that NB produced the best perfor-\\nmance. Gupta et al. (2021) analyzed social media data for public\\nperception on COVID-19 issues using various classiﬁcation models\\nand found that the SVM model performed the best.\\nSupervised learning has the advantage of using labeled or anno-\\ntated data to train the classiﬁer, enabling the extraction of patterns\\nto provide more accurate predictions. However, a notable disad-\\nvantage of this approach is that it is domain-dependent, which\\nmeans that the performance of the classiﬁer is impacted if it\\nencounters data outside of its domain or was not seen during the\\nlearning stage ( An et al., 2019; To et al., 2017 ). A further disadvan-\\ntage is the effort required to create the training set for inference\\nprocess ( Gu et al., 2022; Xie and Chen, 2022 ).\\nii Unsupervised learning\\nThe unsupervised learning approach does not require labeled\\ntraining data. It leverages hidden structures or semantic associa-\\ntions in unlabeled data and can be applied to text data without\\nmanual intervention ( Aggarwal and Zhai, 2012; Pedrycz and\\nChen, 2016 ). Two common unsupervised approaches used in senti-\\nment analysis and opinion mining for public security are clustering\\nand topic modeling. Clustering is the process of grouping data intoM.S.

Clustering has been employed to assess the impact of topics\\nin the context of predicted events ( An et al., 2019 ). In sentiment\\nanalysis, researchers have set thresholds for keyword frequency\\nin documents related to an event ( Xu et al., 2017 ) or orientation\\nof the sentiment ( Ma et al., 2016 ). In recent work, the K-Means,\\nK-Medoids and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application\\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms are the most commonly used. In\\nclustering public opinion on natural disasters, Mustakim (2021)\\ncompared K-Medoids and DBSCAN and found that DBSCAN per-\\nformed better with a higher Silhouette Index (SI). In Bansal et al.\\n(2021) it was also found that DBSCAN outperformed other algo-\\nrithms in clustering multi-domain non-natural events. Topic mod-eling has been achieved through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),\\na commonly used model found in this survey. Li et al. (2016) pro-\\nposed an unsupervised topic sentiment for the automatic classiﬁ-\\ncation of Chinese social media data. Gu et al. (2021) used the\\nLDA model to extract emerging topics amongst Weibo users during\\nan emergency, and Cao et al. (2021) used the LDA model for cate-\\ngorizing topics in social media posts during Wuhan lockdown.\\nThe advantage of unsupervised learning is it does not require\\nlabeled or annotated data. This approach also outperforms manual\\nselection of keywords for sentiment analysis in identifying event-\\nrelated keywords for public security purposes ( Li et al., 2017 ).\\nHowever, unsatisfactory results have been reported in sentiment\\nanalysis for non-dependent features or out-of-domain keywords\\n(de Carvalho and Costa, 2022 ;Li et al., 2016 ).\\niii Semi-supervised learning\\nThe semi-supervised learning uses a small amount of labeled or\\nannotated data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data for\\nclassiﬁcation. However, this approach has been the least used in\\nthe recent work considered in the review reported here due to\\nits lower classiﬁcation performance results ( Sharma and Jain,\\n2020 ). (Zhang et al. (2020) leveraged a semi-supervised SVM to\\ntrain a model using only a small training set of labeled data to clas-\\nsify emotions in the emergency situation of Hurricane Irma.\\nRecently, Qin and Ronchieri (2022) utilized 20% of labeled data to\\npredict the classes of the remaining data and produce a classiﬁca-\\ntion model for sentiment related to pandemic events.\\nSemi-supervised learning takes advantage of the small amount\\nof labeled data to automate the data labeling process and over-\\ncome the expense of data labeling and annotation. However,\\nsemi-supervised learning is not applicable to all sentiment analysis\\nproblems, especially for data that require rule-based featureextraction ( Behl et al., 2021 ).\\niv Ensemble learning\\nThe ensemble approach idea is to combine outputs from multi-\\nple base learners to produce a single output that yields better clas-\\nsiﬁcation performance ( Guyon et al., 2008 ). Among the most\\ncommonly implemented types of ensembles are bagging and\\nboosting, in addition to stacking and RF ( Bhosale and Patnaik,\\n2023; Hung et al., 2015 ). Bagging trains each base learner on a dif-\\nferent bootstrap sample taken from the input data, while boosting\\nbuilds a model incrementally by adding weights to the data mis-\\nclassiﬁed by the base classiﬁers Zong et al. (2021) .Chouhan\\n(2021) developed a gradient boosting classiﬁer to differentiate\\ntypes of non-situational tweets during the Pulwama Terrorist\\nAttack. Tsai and Wang (2020) proposed an ensemble method by\\ncombining pre-trained and early-trained models for COVID-19-\\nrelated tweet analysis. Mamta et al. (2020) perform sentimentanalysis on multi-domain sentiment corpora of crime, emergency,terrorism and cyber security using an ensemble of Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and\\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU).\\nEnsemble learning presents a robust strategy for addressing\\nchallenges associated with multiple learning models by facilitating\\nthe creation of intelligently integrated models ( Bhosale and\\nPatnaik, 2023 ). It has been shown to improve sentiment analysis\\nperformance in recent work, with boosting generally outperform-\\ning bagging ( Chouhan, 2021; Tsai and Wang, 2020 ;Wang et al.,\\n2016 ). However, ensemble methods require a deeper understand-\\ning of the dataset for feature extraction and may require complex\\narchitectures ( Mamta, 2020 ).\\nv Deep learning\\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that employs\\ndeep neural networks and data learning presentations ( Razali\\net al., 2021 ;Yue et al., 2019 ). Deep learning can be utilized in\\nsupervised, partially supervised, or unsupervised learning settings\\n(Gupta and Agrawal, 2020 ). In machine learning methods, deep\\nlearning offers solutions to complex problems by deriving insight-\\nful knowledge from straightforward representations. The promi-\\nnence of neural network approaches is largely due to their ability\\nto learn precise representations, a critical structural feature\\n(Bhosale and Patnaik, 2022 ). In the ﬁeld of sentiment analysis\\nand opinion mining for public security, researchers have shown a\\ngrowing interest in applying deep learning techniques. For\\ninstance, Gu et al. (2021) proposed a Bi-Directional Long Short-\\nTerm Memory (Bi-LSTM) to identify a positive, negative, or neutral\\nsentiment from social media activities during emergency events.\\nPran et al. (2020) compared CNN and LSTM for sentiment analysis\\ntowards COVID-19 using the Bangla language and found that CNN\\nperformed better in accuracy. Chen et al. (2021) ) experimented\\nwith a deep transformer network, namely the Bidirectional Enco-\\nder Representations from Transformers (BERT), with Neural Net-\\nwork (NN) for sentiment classiﬁcation both before and after the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Recently, Zhang et al. (2022) ﬁne-tuned the\\nBERT inspired model, ERNIE, on pandemic outbreak datasets to\\nachieve better classiﬁcation performance.\\nThe deep learning approach has the advantage of producing\\nbetter classiﬁcation performance results using the coarse-grained\\nand deep features of the dataset ( Chandra et al., 2020; Garcia\\nand Berton, 2021 ). The deep learning approach, speciﬁcally in\\ndomain-related tasks, can perform better with a few adjustments\\nmade at the feature extraction level ( Lin and Moh, 2021 ). However,\\nthe disadvantages of deep learning include the large amount of\\ndata required to generate the model ( Behl et al., 2021; El Ali\\net al., 2018 ) and the high cost of training to build the model ( Lin\\nand Moh, 2021; Sadiq et al., 2020 ).\\n4.7.2. Lexicon approaches\\nBased on the recent work surveyed, another approach for senti-\\nment analysis and opinion mining for public security is the\\nlexicon-based approach. The lexicon-based is divided into two:\\ndictionary-based and corpus-based. The following subsections\\ndescribe the details of each approach.\\ni Dictionary-based\\nDictionary-based lexicon approaches utilize a dictionary that\\nintegrates the polarity of the terms. When a word is discovered\\nin a text, a lookup in the dictionary is conducted, and then the sen-\\ntiment score is calculated. From the survey, many dictionaries have\\nbeen used such as Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Rea-\\nsoner (VADER) Hutto and Gilbert (2014) , WordNet ( Miller, 1995 ),M.S. Md Suhaimin, M.H.

(2001) , AFINN ( Nielsen, 2011 ), Word-Emotion Association\\nLexicon (EmoLex) ( Mohammad and Turney, 2013 ), and TextBlob\\nLoria et al. (2014) . For Chinese sentiment analysis during the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, BosonNLP ( Min et al., 2015 ), a sentiment dic-\\ntionary constructed from labeled Weibo, news and forum data, was\\nused ( Yu et al., 2020 ). Additionally, HowNet (a large-scale knowl-\\nedge database of Chinese) was used for feature engineering to feed\\ninto deep learning model for emergency event detection ( Li and\\nWang, 2021 ).\\nThe advantage of the dictionary-based method is that it is sim-\\nple to implement and does not rely on labeled or annotated data\\n(Becken et al., 2022 ). However, the sentiment analysis performance\\nof a dictionary-based method is limited by the quality of the rules\\nthat integrate the polarity and lexicons in the dictionary ( Chen and\\nJi, 2021 ;Li et al., 2020 ;Zhang and Cheng, 2021 ). Additionally, the\\ncoverage of social media words in existing dictionaries is often\\nincomplete and requires expansion ( Pan et al., 2022 ;Qin et al.,\\n2022 ).\\nii Corpus-based\\nThe corpus-based lexicon approach relies on co-occurrence pat-\\nterns and a seed list of words to ﬁnd other sentiment words in a\\nlarge corpus ( Liu, 2011 ). Hence the corpus-based approach\\nrequires a large training corpus to compute the polarity of the\\nwords ( Agarwal and Mittal, 2016 ). In the survey presented in\\n(Zhou, 2021 ), microblog corpora were obtained for multiple emer-\\ngency events by retrieving event keywords and then measuring the\\ninﬂuence of the event using a calculated equation. The work pre-\\nsented in Abid et al. (2017) adopted diverse data sources to pro-\\nduce heterogeneous content to improve a corpus. The authors\\nlater obtained other XML data structures from different social\\nmedia and uniﬁed them into a single structure, targeting the detec-\\ntion of suspicious content circulated on social media that could\\nthreaten public security. Jiang et al. (2017) proposed the Word\\nEmotion Association Network (WEAN) to compute the emotion\\nof words based on nouns, verbs, adjectives and cyber words in\\nthe corpus acquired. The results produced better sentiment analy-\\nsis performance when applied to the emergency event of The\\nMalaysia Airlines MH370 dataset from Sina Weibo. Thorat and\\nNamrata Mahender (2019) created a corpus based on drought syn-\\nonym tweets and later generated patterns for predicting tweet\\npolarity.\\nThe advantage of the corpus-based approach is that it provides\\nbetter performance for the speciﬁc domain for which it is devel-\\noped ( Abid et al., 2017; Thorat and Namrata Mahender, 2019 ).However, it requires a large amount of data to build an informative\\ncorpus ( Suﬁ and Khalil, 2022; Theja Bhavaraju et al., 2019 ). Fur-\\nthermore, the performance of sentiment analysis in a domain-\\nspeciﬁc corpus is usually low if transferred to other domains\\n(Zhou, 2021; Zong et al., 2021 ).\\n4.7.3. Hybrid\\nFrom the literature, some of the reported work has adopted a\\nhybrid approach to analyze sentiment concerning public threats,\\nwhich combines the machine learning and lexicon-basedapproaches. This method was developed to compensate for the\\nshortcomings of machine learning and lexicon-based approaches\\nwhen used separately, and is the most preferred approach after\\nsupervised learning. The reported work directed at hybrid\\napproaches tends to leverage lexicons to extract features and use\\nmachine learning to classify the sentiment, rather than the calcula-\\ntion of the polarity based solely on the lexicon. For example, Akbar\\net al. (2021) extracted a feature set based on the corpus lexicon of\\nCOVID-19 lockdown public opinion before applying a series of\\nsupervised machine learning classiﬁers to analyze the sentiment.\\nThe result using Bernoulli NB achieved optimal values over other\\nclassiﬁers. Recently, ( Pan et al., 2022 ) expanded the corpus-based\\nlexicon for the Weibo COVID-19 dataset before experimenting with\\nseveral machine learning algorithms. The RF showed the highest\\nclassiﬁcation performance among all tested algorithms.\\nThe advantage of the hybrid approach is that it improves the\\nperformance of the sentiment analysis compared to using only\\neither the lexicon or machine learning approach alone ( An et al.,\\n2019; Chandra et al., 2020; Garcia and Berton, 2021 ;Zhang et al.,\\n2019 ). However, the hybrid approach requires a complex frame-\\nwork or structure to implement Chen et al. (2019) ;(Khatua et al.,\\n2020; Tang et al., 2022 ;Xia et al., 2020 ).\\n4.7.4. Manual coding\\nManual coding is an approach that relies on human coders to\\nread and code subsampled datasets using pre-deﬁned rules ( Li\\net al., 2016 ). The particular rules can be performed repeatedly or\\ndifferently. For example, manual coding was performed separately\\nfor positive statements and negative statements ( Gascó et al.,\\n2017 ). The manual codes were then veriﬁed before being assigned,\\nand were then used for training and testing using a larger dataset\\n(Henríquez-Coronel et al., 2019 ).\\nThe advantage of manual coding is that speciﬁc rules can be\\napplied to produce a better performance analysis system. Despite\\nbeing expensive, this approach has the potential to overcome the\\nproblem of scalability and replicability by providing deeper\\ninsights into each task ( Van Atteveldt et al., 2021 ).

Analysis of trend, issues and future directions of sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining for public security\\nThis section presents the trend analysis of work considered in\\nthis survey. The trend for each of the aforementioned attributes\\nis presented with the goal of demonstrating the progress of the\\nwork and the direction in which the researchers have moved over\\nthe last seven years. Based on the selected works in this survey, a\\nthreshold of ﬁve articles is considered for each year to be included\\nfor better trend visualization. Consideration was also needed to\\nensure the representativeness of articles against the practical lim-\\nitation of the considered work ( Groves et al., 2011 ), and to make\\nmeaningful conclusions about trends or patterns in the data\\n(Cohen, 1988 ). The demonstrated trends may be useful in deter-\\nmining the direction of future research in this domain. Section 5.1\\nto 5.7 present the analysis of the trends within the work consid-\\nered in this survey. Section 5.8 . identiﬁes some remaining issues\\nthat the authors deem pertinent and describes possible future\\ndirections for research in social media sentiment analysis and\\nopinion mining in public security.\\n5.1. Trend analysis of sentiment analysis and opinion mining\\nobjectives for public security\\nFig. 5 a depicts the trend associated with the objectives attri-\\nbute. The analysis of events and improvement of techniques have\\nemerged as the primary areas of interest within the research com-\\nmunity, with the number of publications focused on these objec-\\ntives showing an upward trend since 2019. This trend could be\\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby most work focused\\non efforts to understand events and explore techniques for mitigat-\\ning them. Meanwhile, the number of multipurpose publications\\nhas slightly increased since 2020, while corpus generation remains\\nlimited over time.\\nFig. 5 b depicts the distribution of the objectives from 2016 to\\n2023. Analysis of events and technique improvement are the most\\ncommon, accounting for 41% and 39% of the existing work respec-\\ntively. This observation demonstrates that researchers were inter-\\nested in understanding events by analyzing them and proposing\\ntechniques to improve the detection or the prediction ability of\\nmodels. The distribution of multipurpose objectives came third at\\n16%. In contrast, corpus generation is the least common objective,due to most of the published work considered using existing cor-pora to validate and verify their proposed techniques ( Backfried\\nand Shalunts, 2016; Kostakos et al., 2018 ;Wang et al., 2016 ).\\n5.2. Trend analysis of domain of interest in public security\\nFig. 6 a depicts the trend of work that concentrated on public\\nsecurity in the natural and non-natural domain. From the ﬁgure,\\ncompared to other domains, it can be seen that the natural disaster\\ndomain increased linearly until 2020, before it decreased. Mean-\\nwhile, the public health domain has experienced a sudden increase\\nfrom 2020 until recently. This is due to the sudden demand for\\nresearch on the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be seen in public\\nhealth domain surge from 2020. Compared to other domains, thenon-natural domain of emergency demonstrated a rapid increase\\nfrom 2019 to 2020. This category’s focus groups included emer-\\ngency situations, accidents, and energy incidents. However, it\\ndecreased in 2021 and 2022, while chaos and multi-domain inter-\\nests increased, indicating a desire to combine multiple domain\\ntypes for the analysis of multiple events.\\nFig. 6 b depicts the distribution of recent work in the public\\nsecurity domain. Public health and natural disasters have domi-\\nnated the recent work, accounting for 32% and 25% of the total\\nwork respectively. The majority of the works focus on the emer-\\ngency domain (16%), which is followed by chaos (13%). The high\\npercentage of works in the emergency domain could be due to\\nthe frequent sharing of data related to emergency events on social\\nmedia. Crisis comes in ﬁfth place with 5%, followed by multi-\\ndomain with 4%. The cyber and technology domain has the second\\nlowest percentage at 3%, which could be because only a small num-\\nber of people directly involved in the cyber security domain share\\nor discuss related topics. However, the number of published works\\nthat integrate both natural disaster and public health remain lim-\\nited, comprising only 2% of the total. This is could be due to lack of\\nwork that connects the two domains based on public reaction.\\nMoreover, combining both domains also leads to large-scale data\\ncoverage ( Albayrak and Gray-Roncal, 2019 ;Li et al., 2017 ).\\n5.3. Trend analysis of event timeframe\\nFig. 7 a depicts the trend of the event timeframe attribute. From\\nthe ﬁgure, it can be seen that the post-event timeframe attracted\\nthe most interest up until 2020, when the during-event timeframe\\nfeatured signiﬁcant increase. This increase is caused by the emer-\\ngence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a shift in research\\nattention towards the existing pandemic-focused public health\\nFig. 6.

Trend analysis of social media platforms used\\nFig. 8 a shows the trend of the social media platforms used for\\nresearch in the public security domain.

Sina Weibo comes in second with\\n25%, followed by mixed platforms with 11%. In contrast, Facebook,\\nYouTube, and other platforms are still underutilized for public\\nsecurity data acquisition. This could be due to the low popularity\\nof these platforms for real-time discussion and the difﬁculty of\\nacquiring data from these platforms for research purposes.\\n5.5. Trend analysis of language of dataset used\\nFig. 9 a depicts the language of the datasets used in the context\\nof the considered published work in sentiment analysis and opin-\\nion mining for public security. The use of monolingual datasets has\\nsteadily increased over time. This trend can be attributed to the\\nwide availability of pre-processing approaches and resources for\\nfeature engineering speciﬁc to monolingual data. Based on the\\ntrend, the study of bilingual and multilingual public security islow. However, the trend is gradually increasing since 2020,\\nalthough interest remains relatively low compared to the monolin-\\ngual work. This trend suggested a growing interest among\\nresearchers in investigating sentiment analysis and opinion mining\\nacross different languages, in particular in the bilingual context,\\nwithin the public security domain. It was found that bilingual stud-\\nies were conducted because there was a need for the analysis of\\ncompounding language in the dataset as a result of the uniqueness\\nof the language itself. This is particularly relevant as bilingual com-ments are common among the public, making them a valuable\\nsource of information for sentiment analysis and opinion mining.\\nFig. 9 b depicts the language distribution of the dataset used.\\nMonolingual datasets dominate the work surveyed, comprising\\n89% of the total. The bilingual and multilingual datasets remain\\nsigniﬁcantly low, at 7% and 4%, respectively.\\n5.6. Trend analysis of dataset type used\\nFig. 10 a depicts the trend in the types of datasets used with\\nrespect to published work in sentiment analysis and opinion min-\\ning for public security. Private datasets have exhibited a steady\\nincrease in usage over the years, whereas the use of public datasets\\nhas remained constant with a slight increase in recent years. This\\ntrend suggests that researchers in the public security domain pre-\\nfer to use their own datasets for analysis and testing their senti-\\nment analysis approach, which may raise concerns about the\\ngeneralizability of the output. The marginal increase in the usage\\nof public datasets in 2020 and 2021 can be attributed to the wide\\navailability and sharing of COVID-19 datasets for urgent global\\nanalysis.\\nThe distribution of dataset types used is illustrated in Fig. 10 b.\\nThe chart shows that the vast majority of the surveyed work,\\n77% used private datasets, while only 23% used public datasets.\\nDespite the predominance of private datasets over public ones,\\nthe public datasets that see the most use are predominantly from\\nthe public health domain, followed by natural disaster. Fig. 11\\nshows the overall dataset usage distribution among related works\\nin the public security domain. Public health datasets constitute the\\nmajor chunk, amounting to 38% of overall use, followed by natural\\ndisaster datasets at 35%. The most frequently used public health\\ndataset is the daily updated COVID-19 tweets dataset ( Lamsal,\\n2020 ), while the Nepal Earthquake 2015 and Italy Earthquake\\n2016 datasets ( Basu et al., 2019 ) top the list for natural disasters.\\nThe popularity of these datasets can be attributed to their early\\navailability as large-scale public resources within their respective\\ndomains, making them highly valuable for sentiment analysisand opinion mining during and in the aftermath of speciﬁc events.\\n5.7.

Issues and future direction of social media sentiment analysis and\\nopinion mining for public security\\nThis section presents the remaining issues, as well as potential\\nfuture directions, of research work in social media sentiment anal-\\nysis and opinion mining for public security. The state-of-the-art\\nsocial media sentiment analysis for the public is plagued by several\\nissues that can be identiﬁed from the presented trend analysis and\\nhighlighted in this survey. The issues are presented in Subsection\\n5.8.1, and potential future work is presented in Subsection 5.8.2.\\n5.8.1. Issues\\nBased on the surveyed articles, there were ﬁve major issues\\nidentiﬁed: (i) shortage of multi-class and different level analysis\\napproaches; (ii) insufﬁcient availability of public security\\ndomain-independent datasets; (iii) inadequate prediction based\\non timeframe coverage; (iv) lack of supporting approaches for vari-\\nations across different languages; and (v) limited information\\navailability.\\n(i) Shortage of multi-class and different level analysis\\napproaches: When dealing with multi-objective studies,\\nresearchers can beneﬁt from multi-level sentiment analysis\\nand opinion mining. Such scenarios encounter challengesin multi-class classiﬁcation ( Bashar, 2022 ;Gupta et al.,\\n2021 ). Speciﬁcally, tri-class classiﬁcation can be problem-\\natic, as some data points may straddle the borders of multi-\\nple categories ( Bhullar et al., 2022; Garcia and Berton, 2021 ;\\nGupta et al., 2021 ). Additionally, different levels of analysis,\\nsuch as ﬁne-grained emotion analysis, may lead to low clas-\\nsiﬁcation performance ( Zhou and Zhang, 2017 ). Further-\\nmore, addressing each problem may require distinct\\ntechniques ( Zhou and Jing, 2020 ).\\n(ii) Insufﬁcient availability of public security domain-\\nindependent datasets: As sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmining are increasingly applied to public security domains,it is crucial to have a domain-independent dataset to ensure\\nreliable results ( de Carvalho and Costa, 2022 ). However, the\\navailability of training and validation datasets for events\\nthat threaten public security is minimal ( Behl et al., 2021;\\nZhou, 2021 ). The trend analysis of dataset types revealed a\\nlack of public dataset availability in the public security\\ndomain, and recent work was found to often rely on datasets\\nfrom other domains for training ( Fuadvy and Ibrahim, 2019;\\nTo et al., 2017 ). This presents a challenge for sentiment anal-\\nysis and opinion mining models as using corpora based on\\nother domains is typically larger than a domain-speciﬁc cor-\\npus, potentially leading to reduced performance.\\n(iii) Inadequate prediction based on timeframe coverage: The\\npublished work that focused on trend analysis for automatic\\ndetection or prediction at the pre-event timeframe, as\\ndescribed in Section 4.2.1 , is very limited. The detection of\\nan event’s starting point, such as a natural disaster or emer-\\ngency event, or an outbreak of a disease or a pandemic, is the\\nmost important key factor for early warning and forecasting\\nof public threats ( Lamsal et al., 2022 ). The problem of misin-\\nformation that creates noise or false detection was found to\\noften hinder prediction performance ( Fang et al., 2022; Luna\\net al., 2022; Suﬁ and Khalil, 2022 ).\\n(iv) Lack of supporting approaches for variations across different\\nlanguages: The language perspective has become a major\\nissue that has hampered sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmodel performance for public security. Multilanguage varia-\\ntion across different regions ( Dahal et al., 2019; Geeta, 2016;\\nKostakos et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016 ), ﬁgurative language\\nsuch as irony and sarcasm ( Andhale et al., 2021 ;Gupta\\nFig. 12.

Furthermore, the limited lexicon\\nsources and analysis approaches, have served to further\\ncomplicate this issue. The problem is also hampered by the\\nlimitations of feature extraction techniques ( Andhale et al.,\\n2021; de Carvalho and Costa, 2022; Mohamed Ridhwan\\nand Hargreaves, 2021 ).\\n(v) Limited information availability: The unavailability of com-\\nprehensive data was a major limitation found in the study,\\nattributed to users withholding crucial information or\\nrestrictions imposed by social media platforms. Users\\nrefrained from disclosing important details, such as the geo-\\ngraphical location or event-related references ( Sattaru et al.,\\n2021 ). While platform restrictions such as limited access to\\nuser proﬁles and data acquisition timeframes added to the\\nscarcity of information. These constraints within the mes-\\nsage content have adversely impacted the overall sentiment\\ndistribution Alomari et al. (2020) ;Chowdhury et al. (2022) ;\\nWu and Cui (2018) . Consequently, imbalanced sentiment\\ndistribution has resulted in ﬂawed analyses ( Zhu et al.,\\n2020 ), limiting the accuracy and reliability of the ﬁndings.\\n5.8.2. Potential future works\\nThis sub-section outlines potential work for further advance-\\nment in the ﬁeld of social media sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmining, speciﬁcally in relation to public security. These projections\\nare based on the trend analysis and issue identiﬁcation discussed\\nin the preceding section. The recommended future works focus\\non intensifying analysis levels, improving the relevance of the\\ndataset, utilizing variations of features to enhance outbreak detec-\\ntion, offering better language/ lexicon support, and mitigating\\ninformation exhaustion. It is anticipated that addressing these\\nfocal points may tackle critical challenges in the public security\\ndomain, thereby contributing substantively to the evolution of sen-\\ntiment analysis and opinion mining. The suggested future work is\\nenumerated as follows:\\n(i) More extensive multi-class and multi-level analysis: Multi-\\ntasking with multidimensional sentiment analysis and opin-\\nion mining could overcome the unspeciﬁed approach for the\\nproblem domain. It also can overcome the difﬁculties for\\nresearchers who need to analyze a speciﬁc event quickly.\\nAccording to the trend analysis of the objectives of the pub-\\nlished work considered, the number of multipurpose objec-\\ntives is still low when compared to other studies. This\\nhighlights a signiﬁcant gap in the current research, where\\nthe value of nuanced, detailed analysis is not being fullyrealized. Future work must focus extensively on multi-\\nclass and multi-level approaches, especially to address sub-\\ntle class and level differences. Pre-trained transformers with\\nunique embeddings can be experimented with, as they offer\\na superior classiﬁcation approach in language models to\\nenhance comprehensive multi-class and multi-level analysis\\n(Sun et al., 2022 ); (Xia et al., 2022 ). Utilizing these advanced\\ncomputational tools can yield more detailed and nuanced\\nsentiment analysis, enabling the capture subtleties in public\\nopinion that might otherwise go unnoticed.\\n(ii) Production of a multi-domain public security datasets: As\\nnoted earlier in this survey, much existing published work\\nused private datasets for speciﬁc events. Extra effort is\\nrequired to obtain a larger dataset that encompasses multi-\\nple public security domains. The rationale for this is that lar-\\nger datasets provide more representative and diverse\\nsamples that can help in improving the robustness and gen-\\neralizability of the models. Access to more data can substan-tially enhance the performance of sentiment analysis and\\nopinion models ( Alfred and Obit, 2021 ). Additionally, the\\ndiversity of data will also serve as a catalyst for the develop-\\nment of new relevant techniques. Having access to a wider\\nvariety of data enables researchers to gain insights into dif-\\nferent types of public sentiment, which can lead to the cre-\\nation of more effective and tailored strategies for each sub-\\ndomain.\\n(iii) Utilization of a greater variety of features and techniques for\\nautomatic detection of outbreaks: Due to the limited data for\\nthe pre-event timeframe, it is essential to employ diverse\\nfeatures and prediction techniques to build better models.\\nUtilizing data from multiple domains, as recommended in\\n(i), can yield diverse datasets to facilitate feature extraction\\nand transfer learning for detection and implementation.Moreover, network-based studies can be used to monitor\\nscenarios within a short event window. Dissemination net-\\nworks, such as social network analysis, provide monitoring\\ntools based on structures and relationships to identify key\\nnodes. This is essential as key nodes often play pivotal rolesin information propagation, and early detection of unusual\\nactivity may serve as an indicator of potential security\\nthreats. Such studies can simulate changes in community\\nactivity and explain the virality phenomenon within the des-\\nignated timeframe ( Chung and Zeng, 2018 ;Ma et al., 2020 ),\\nproviding valuable insight for predicting and detecting out-\\nbreaks in a timely manner.\\n(iv) Establishment of cross-language corpora and supporting\\napproaches: Cross-language lexicon corpus from corre-\\nsponding language datasets and larger datasets for valida-\\ntion could be used to address language processing issues.\\nThis becomes increasingly important considering the global\\nnature of social media and public security issues. Different\\ncommunities, cultures, and countries express sentiments in\\nunique ways, and it is important to account for these linguis-\\ntic differences to ensure accurate sentiment analysis and\\nopinion mining. According to the objective trend analysis\\npresented in Fig. 12 , there has been a lack of work focusing\\non corpus generation. For the development of sentiment\\nanalysis and opinion mining for public security, an approach\\nthat does not rely solely on translation accuracy must be\\ninvestigated. NLP features can be diversiﬁed with domain\\ncorpus for the feature extraction. A modiﬁcation of transfer\\nlearning that supports multilanguage in public security\\ndomain can also be proposed. This approach could poten-\\ntially create a more inclusive model, capable of understand-\\ning a wider range of sentiment from various linguistic\\ncommunities, thereby improving the overall effectivenessand reach of sentiment analysis and opinion mining in the\\npublic security domain.\\n(v) Expansion of data acquisition and geographical coverage:\\nAddressing the issues of limited data availability and imbal-\\nanced sentiment data distribution requires expanding data\\nacquisition across multiple platforms. This not only provide\\na larger pool of data but also help in achieving a more repre-\\nsentative sample, capturing a broader array of sentiments\\nfrom various demographics and geographical locations. Geo-\\ngraphical coverage areas can be extended, for instance, by\\nincreasing the radius of the area ( Yuan and Liu, 2020 ). Fur-\\nthermore, acquiring more data and integrating the Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) approach in the pre-processing\\nstage for location detection in message dissemination can\\nalso improve sentiment data distribution Barachi et al.\\n(2022) . Expanding geographical coverage and improving\\ndata acquisition can lead to more accurate sentiment analy-\\nsis, as it accounts for regional differences in sentimentM.S. Md Suhaimin, M.H.

Discussion\\nThis survey paper set out with the aim of constructing a taxon-\\nomy for state-of-the-art sentiment analysis and opinion mining\\nmethods applicable to the public security domain, analyzing recent\\ntrends, and identifying gaps and potential future areas of research.\\nFirst, the objective trends in sentiment analysis and opinion\\nmining within the public security domain are projected to display\\nan increasing focus on speciﬁc events, following the trends indi-\\ncated in Section 5.1 . This shift may be due to the growing realiza-\\ntion that event-speciﬁc approaches allow for ﬁne-tuned analyticsthat can provide nuanced and actionable insights. However, this\\nrequires advancements in the system’s ﬂexibility and adaptability\\nto different events, thus indicating a key area for future innovation.\\nDespite the need for larger and more varied datasets, the genera-\\ntion of new corpora is predicted to remain low, primarily due to\\nhigh computational costs and challenges associated with multi-\\ndomain and multilingual data. However, this gap presents an\\nopportunity for future research to explore more efﬁcient and effec-\\ntive data generation methods.\\nSecond, regarding the focus within the public security domain,\\nan anticipated surge is expected in the domain of public health.\\nThis projection is informed by trend analyses discussed in Sec-\\ntion 5.2 and is further reinforced by a substantial amount of related\\nwork concentrating on during-event scenarios, such as COVID-19.\\nThis assumption is grounded in the continued global emphasis\\non public health and the potential of sentiment analysis to provide\\nreal-time public reactions and insights, a resource crucial for\\nresponsive and efﬁcient policy-making.\\nThird, as for the utilization of social media platforms, Twitter\\nand Sina Weibo are likely to maintain their dominance as indicated\\ninSection 5.4 . This trend is likely to persist due to their ease of data\\nacquisition, extensive user base, and the availability of robust ana-\\nlytical tools, enabling more comprehensive sentiment analysis and\\nopinion mining.\\nFourth, in terms of the language used in datasets, as discussed\\ninSection 5.5 , monolingual data is expected to continue to domi-\\nnate over bilingual and multilingual data. However, as methods\\nfor monolingual analysis become more established, research inter-\\nest in bilingual and multilingual data is likely to grow. This shift\\nwill be crucial in the globalized context of social media, where\\npublic opinion is diverse and multilingual. On the topic of dataset\\nusage in the public security domain in Section 5.6 , although private\\ndatasets are often employed, it is expected that public datasets willbe shared more frequently as they are studied and analyzed. This\\nshift can enhance transparency and enable collaborative efforts\\nacross different studies.\\nFifth, as discussed in Section 5.7 , the hybrid approach for senti-\\nment analysis and opinion mining will likely remain popular due\\nto its proven effectiveness in combining multiple approaches.\\nHowever, with the exponentially advancements in deep learning,\\nan increase in research interest is expected in this area. This pre-\\ndiction is based on the recent surge in computational power and\\nthe potential of deep learning to automate and enhance sentiment\\nanalysis. In light of this trend, future taxonomies or surveys on sen-\\ntiment analysis and opinion mining in the public security domain\\nmay focus on deep learning methods. This shift could catalyze fur-\\nther innovations in the ﬁeld and provide valuable insights into the\\nevolving landscape of sentiment analysis.\\nWhile this survey has made signiﬁcant strides in mapping the\\nlandscape of sentiment analysis and opinion mining in the domain\\nof public security, it is important to acknowledge its limitations.Primarily, this survey has not extensively covered public security\\nwithin the domain of cybersecurity. The nexus of cyber security\\nand public safety is indeed signiﬁcant and increasingly salient in\\nan ever-more digitally connected world. However, the availability\\nof related works speciﬁc to this intersection was limited based\\non search queries’ result. Moreover, this area was not within the\\nintended scope of this survey. Future surveys could look to address\\nthis by speciﬁcally including cyber security within their purview. A\\nsecond limitation lies in the lack of a comparative evaluation of the\\nperformance of machine learning and lexicon-based approach. The\\nworks under consideration differed considerably in their objec-\\ntives, methodologies, and levels of detail provided. For instance,\\nwhile some research focused on the successful application of an\\napproach, they did not necessarily provide detailed results from\\ntheir experiments or implementations. In other cases, the focuswas primarily on statistical analysis, informed by the speciﬁc\\nobjectives of the study. The heterogeneity in the focus and depth\\nof the analyzed studies precluded a thorough head-to-head com-\\nparison of these techniques. By acknowledging these limitations,\\nadditional review works could be useful to yield further valuable\\ninsights on the performance comparison of the existing work.\\n7. Conclusions\\nMore research work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining\\nfor public security domain has been conducted over the years.\\nHowever, there have been limited systematic surveys on the cur-\\nrent state of this work. Therefore, a more systematic survey, sup-\\nported by a descriptive taxonomy, was presented here; a\\ntaxonomy that classiﬁes attributes.\\nThis survey papers summarize the key concepts of the existing\\nwork on social media sentiment analysis and opinion mining for\\npublic security by organizing a taxonomy. Relevant indexed arti-\\ncles from Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct are extracted\\nusing keyword searching. Related journals, conference proceed-\\nings, and serials underwent identiﬁcation, screening, and review\\nfor inclusion in this survey. The taxonomy includes seven key attri-\\nbutes; objectives of the work conducted, the domain of public\\nsecurity, the public security event timeframe, the social media\\nplatform of the data acquisition, the dataset type, language of the\\ndataset, and the sentiment analysis or opinion mining approach\\nused. An analysis of the trends featured in the recent work consid-\\nered, and the distribution on topics based on the identiﬁed attri-\\nbutes from the taxonomy, was also presented.\\nThe remaining issues and future direction of social media senti-\\nment analysis and opinion mining for public security were estab-\\nlished and described in the second half of the survey. Five issueswere identiﬁed; (i) shortage of multi-class and different level anal-\\nysis approaches; (ii) insufﬁcient availability of public security\\ndomain-independent datasets; (iii) inadequate prediction based\\non timeframe coverage; (iv) lack of supporting approach for varia-\\ntion across different languages; and (v) limited information avail-\\nability. Five potential areas of future work for social media\\nsentiment analysis and opinion mining, within the public security\\ndomain, were suggested: (i) more extensive multi-class and multi-\\nlevel analysis; (ii) production of multi-domain public security\\ndatasets; (iii) utilization of greater variety of features and tech-\\nnique for automatic detection of outbreaks; (iv) establishment of\\ncross-language corpora and supporting approaches; and (v) expan-\\nsion of data acquisition and geographical coverage.\\nTo conclude, recent work on social media sentiment analysis\\nand opinion mining needs extra effort and extensive work with\\nrespect to the public security domain, to ensure the development\\nof the study in the domain and delivery of related applications\\nfor the public beneﬁt.

Introduction  \\nThe field of Twitter sentiment analysis has witnessed extensive exploration, with numerous approaches applied \\nacross varying levels of detail. Sentiment analysis, a facet of Natural Language Processing, has commonly employed \\nMachine Learning algorithms featuring elements like unigrams, n -grams, and Part -Of-Speech (POS) tags [1]. \\nHowever, a notable challenge emerges due to the substantial scale of training datasets, leading to heightened computational demands and time constraints linked to the multitude of features involved. A pivotal query arises: \\nHow can this issue be tackled when lacking access to the formidable computational resources required? The \\nprevailing solution has been to employ a reduced dataset sample. Nonetheless, adopting a smaller randomly selected dataset for training a sentiment analysis model often yields diminished accuracy. In response, this paper presents an innovative methodology for the purpose of sampling tweets to construct a sentiment classification model. The \\nprimary objective revolves around surpassing the current leading methodology, Distant Supervision [2], in terms of \\naccuracy, all the while employing a more condensed subset of tweets. The proposed framework not only culminates \\nin expedited computation but also outperforms the baseline model regarding precision.  \\nExpressions of sentiment often materialize through subjective linguistic constructs, while instances of sentiments \\ncloaked within objective statements remain infrequent [3]. The task of identifying subjectivity proves to be notably more efficient compared to the intricate process of deciphering sentiment. While determining subjectivity can be undertaken on an individual tweet basis, the establishment of a sentiment classification model mandates the incorporation of tweets specifically labeled as conveying positive or negative sentiment. The temporal demands associated with the training of such a model escalates proportionally with the augmentation of the training tweet corpus. The root of this study rests upon harnessing the subjectivity intrinsic to tweets as a guide for the curation of optimal training samples. This meticulous approach manifests in curtailed computation duration and heightened precision due to the utilization of cleaner training data. Furthermore, the features extracted exhibit a closer relevance to the classification endeavor. By imposing a stringent subjectivity threshold for training dataset filtration, especially when computational resources are at a premium, the predictions derived from a reduced dataset are rendered robust, \\nthus mitigating computational burdens. Elaboration on the nuances and contemplations entailed by this strategy is \\ndeferred to subsequent segments of this paper. The amalgamation of rigorous preprocessing methodologies bolsters the model's resilience, ultimately culminating in amplified accuracy levels.  \\nParallel to the employment of machine learning algorithms, a heuristic -driven classification paradigm for tweets \\ntakes the stage. This heuristic harnesses the concept of Effective Word Score (EFWS) [4], as expounded upon in upcoming sections. By assimilating polarity scores of frequently employed terms within tweets, this heuristic propels the accuracy rate to approximately 85% within our dataset, leading to a substantial enhancement of the overarching precision.  \\nOur training data spans a spectrum of generic Twitter messages, transcending the confines of particular topics, \\nwith emoticons serving as the intrinsic source of noise within the labels. Our study demonstrates that when we utilize a training set consisting of 100,000 tweets and a testing set containing 5,000 tweets, our approach achieves an accuracy level of roughly 80% across various classification methods, such as Naive Bayes, RBF -kernel Support \\nVector Machine, and Logistic Regression. It's worth highlighting that our model accomplishes this feat while requiring only about half the time for training compared to the baseline model, and it also achieves higher accuracy \\ncompared to the baseline model in all classification methods. Given that training time is anticipated to undergo \\nexponential growth with expanding datasets, our proposition stands poised to outpace the baseline model in terms of accuracy, and it's envisaged to do so at a velocity at least double that of the baseline model, particularly when \\nconfronted with more expansive datasets.  \\nNeed for Optimization in the Proposed Work: The research paper presents a substantial contribution to the field of \\nsentiment analysis on microblogging platforms, particularly Twitter. The study introduces innovative strategies, such \\nas leveraging tweet subjectivity and incorporating the EFWS heuristic, resulting in improved accuracy and faster \\ntraining.

Turning attention to Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA), it\\'s evident that this arena grapples with distinctive \\nchallenges, the most conspicuous among which is the constraint imposed by message length. With tweets limited to \\na mere 140 characters, discerning the intricate nuances of sentiment becomes an arduous task. This challenge is compounded by the irregular textual manifestations inherent to the Twitter platform, accentuating the inherent complexities. The strategies conceived for TSA are mandated to confront these intricacies head -on, paving the way \\nfor new avenues of investigation [21].  \\nThe application of Distant Supervision, a method for annotating extensive datasets through external references, \\nhas played a significant role in the domain of Twitter Sentiment Analysis. However, as recognized in the research paper, scaling up poses challenges in computational efficiency. Recent research by the authors of [22] introduced a method that combines Distant Supervision with Active Learning, selecting only the most informative instances for human labeling, thereby addressing the computational bottleneck. Enhancing efficiency through feature engineering has been a key area of exploration. Incorporating the concept of Effective Word Score (EFWS), as proposed in the research paper, resonates with the work of the authors of [23], which introduced a lexicon -based method for \\nextracting effective features from social media text, improving sentiment classification accuracy. Hybrid models and \\nensemble learning have shown significant promise in boosting sentiment analysis performance. The fusion of SVM -\\nPSO classification with contemporary progress in ensemble strategies is in line with the study conducted by \\nresearchers in [24]. This research illustrated that the amalgamation of deep learning models and conventional machine learning methodologies via ensemble techniques yields cutting -edge outcomes in sentiment classification. \\nWhile SVM remains a popular choice for sentiment analysis, recent years have seen the emergence of more advanced algorithms. Research by the authors of [25] introduced a sentiment analysis framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), achieving superior accuracy by considering the semantic relationships between words in tweets. Integrating SVM -PSO classification with modern algorithms like GCNs could potentially lead to \\neven better results. Incorporating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Support Vector Machines (SVM), as suggested in the academic paper, aligns with the prevalent approach of employing optimization algorithms for \\nrefining hyperparameters. In a manner akin to your methodology, the authors referenced in [26] employed PSO to \\nfine-tune the hyperparameters of deep learning models, resulting in improved performance on sentiment \\nclassification tasks. Recent advancements in transfer learning have revolutionized the field of NLP, including sentiment analysis. The transformer architecture, demonstrated by BERT and its variants, has yielded remarkable \\nresults. Recent research by the authors of [27] extended BERT to create TwitterBERT, a domain -specific pre -trained \\nmodel, showing substantial improvements in sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Combining SVM -PSO \\nclassification with domain -specific pre -trained models could lead to notable advancements.  \\nLimitations and Issues of Existing Models: Here are some common limitations and issues associated with \\nexisting models in the field:  \\n• Limited Context Understanding: Many existing models struggle with understanding the context of tweets. Twitter posts often contain colloquial language, slang, and contextual references that can be challenging for sentiment analysis models. Ambiguity and sarcasm in tweets can lead to misclassification.  \\n• Data Imbalance: Sentiment analysis datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where one sentiment class is significantly more prevalent than others. This can lead to biased models that perform well on the \\nmajority class but poorly on minority classes.  \\n• Handling Emojis and Emoticons: Emojis and emoticons are commonly used in tweets to express emotions, but many sentiment analysis models struggle to interpret these symbols correctly. Emoticons \\ncan carry sentiment, and their omission may lead to loss of valuable information.  \\n• Limited Linguistic Resources for Social Media Text: Compared to standard text, there are fewer \\nlinguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons) available for social media language. This limitation can impact the accuracy of sentiment classification.  \\n• Handling Negations and Intensifiers: Negations (e.g., \"not good\") and intensifiers (e.g., \"very happy\") can significantly change the sentiment of a tweet. Many models struggle with identifying and correctly \\nhandling these linguistic constructs.  \\n• Short Texts: Tweets are short in length, which means that there is limited textual context for analysis. \\nExisting models may find it challenging to make accurate predictions based on such limited information.

Proposed Methodology  \\nWithin this segment, we expound upon the array of preprocessing methodologies harnessed for the purpose of \\nfeature reduction, supplemented by an additional stage involving the enhancement of the training dataset contingent upon the subjectivity scores attributed to individual tweets.  \\n \\nFig. 1. Proposed block diagram for twitter data sentiment analysis  \\n3.1. Corpus Dataset  \\nThe training data set comprises a grand total of 1.6 million tweets, whereas the test data set comprises 5000 \\ntweets. Notably, the given test dataset comprises a limited set of 500 tweets, prompting the selection of an independent subset from the main training data, consisting of precisely 5000 tweets, to serve as the dedicated test dataset. The process involves the elimination of emoticons from both the training and test data.  \\n3.2. Subjectivity Filtering  \\nPresenting a novel stride to enhance accuracy within a smaller training dataset, we introduce a fresh stage labeled \\n\"Subjectivity Filtering.\" To execute this, TextBlob is employed for the classification of individual tweets into subjective or objective categories. Subsequently, tweets with subjectivity scores falling below a specified threshold (within the 0 to 1 score range) are excluded from consideration. The tweets that remain are subsequently employed for training purposes. As the subjectivity threshold is elevated, a substantial proportion of tweets are found to be \\nexcluded.  \\n3.3.

Repeated Letters  \\nRecognizing the casual nature of tweet language, we address instances where letters are repetitively used. For \\ninstance, variations of \"wow\" like \"wooow\" or \"woooow\" might be encountered on Twitter. To mitigate this, we employ preprocessing wherein any letter that appears more than twice consecutively is replaced with just two occurrences. In the instances mentioned, the resulting token would be \"woow.\" Upon implementing these adjustments, tweets are transformed into lowercase format to prevent any potential confusion arising from content that is identical but divergent in capitalization.  \\n3.3.5.

Their model employs \\nNaive Bayes, SVM, and Maximum Entropy classifiers, utilizing feature arrays that encompass Unigrams, Bigrams, 8 Vijay Gupta  / Procedia Computer Science  00 (2019) 000 –000 \\nUnigrams + Bigrams, or Unigrams + POS tags. The highest attained accuracy results as follows: a) 82.2% in \\nconjunction with the SVM classifier for the Unigram feature array, b) 83.0% coinciding with the MaxEnt classifier \\nfor the Unigram + Bigram feature array, and 82.7% using Naive Bayes, c) 81.9% in partnership with the SVM classifier for the Unigram + POS feature array. These accuracy achievements stem from a training dataset of 1.6 million tweets and a test dataset of 500 tweets. Our experimental approach follows a parallel training dataset, enabling a subsequent comparison of our model\\'s accuracy against the baseline\\'s accuracy metrics derived from a training dataset of 200,000 tweets and a test dataset of 5,000 tweets.  \\n3.3.7.  Effective Word Score (EFWS) Heuristic  \\nBuilding upon the baseline model, the amalgamated feature arrays encompass Unigram, Unigram + Bigram, and \\nUnigram + POS. Before the commencement of training on our dataset, two noteworthy modifications have been executed when contrasted with the baseline model. Primarily, the training dataset undergoes filtration grounded in the subjectivity threshold. Additionally, the scope of our preprocessing measures extends beyond that of the referenced study.  \\nAn additional heuristic, designated as the Effective Word Score (EFWS), is introduced to annotate the test \\ndataset. Alongside dictionaries containing stopwords and acronyms, a repository housing frequently -used words and \\ntheir corresponding polarity scores is upheld. During runtime, synonyms of a word (sourced from WordNet) found within a tweet and the dictionary are taken into account, assigned equivalent polarity scores as the dictionary entry. This process rests on a reasonable assumption: synonyms exhibit minimal polarity disparities. Consequently, the computation of the Effective Word Scores for a tweet takes place.  \\n3.4. Feature Extraction  \\nThe following steps delineate the procedure for generating a TF -IDF (Term Frequency -Inverse Document \\nFrequency) representation from a corpus using both testing and training data. Here\\'s a breakdown of each individual step:  \\n• Construct Corpus using Testing and Training Data: The compilation of documents hails from both the training and testing datasets. A corpus constitutes a compendium of texts or documents designated for \\nanalytical scrutiny. \\n• Calculate Term Frequency (TF): The process involves the computation of the term frequency for every \\nterm (word) present in the documents. This measurement represents the proportion of how often a term appears within a document relative to the overall term count in that document. This phase leads to the formation of a TF matrix where each row is associated with a document and each column represents a term, containing the computed TF values.  \\n• Determine Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): The Inverse Document Frequency is determined for each term. It gauges a term\\'s distinctiveness or significance across the entire corpus. The calculation entails the natural logarithm of the ratio between the total document count and the count of documents that include the term. This step results in the creation of an Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) vector, where each element is associated with a particular term.  \\n• Compute Corpus\\'s TF -IDF Vector: The TF -IDF vector is obtained through element -wise multiplication \\nof the TF matrix and the IDF vector. The resulting TF -IDF vector represents the significance of each \\nterm in each document, considering both its frequency within the document and its scarcity across the \\nentire corpus.  \\nThe TF -IDF representation is a widely employed tool in text analysis, information retrieval, and an array of tasks \\nwithin Natural Language Processing. It adeptly captures the significance of terms within documents while factoring \\nin their dispersion across the entire corpus. This representation proves especially invaluable for endeavors such as document categorization, topic modeling, and the ranking of search engine results.  \\nThe Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is a concept employed in the fields of information retrieval and textual \\nanalysis to assess the significance of a term in a collection of documents, often referred to as a corpus. This metric is a fundamental component of the TF -IDF (Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency) weighting system.

PSO is a population -based optimization technique where each particle represents a \\npossible solution within a search space.

Initialization: In the beginning, a population of particles is created, and each particle is assigned a \\nrandom position within the problem\\'s search space. The fitness of each particle is evaluated based on the objective function to determine how well it performs with its current position.  \\n2. Personal Best (Pbest) Update: Each particle maintains its own \"personal best\" position and fitness value. If the current position of a particle results in a better fitness value than its previously recorded personal best, the particle updates its Pbest to the current position.  \\n3. Global Best (Gbest) Update: Among all the particles in the population, the one with the best fitness value \\nis considered the \"global best\" particle. This is typically based on the fitness value achieved by \\nevaluating the objective function at each particle\\'s position. The Gbest is updated whenever a particle in \\nthe population achieves a better fitness value than the current Gbest.  \\n4.

PSO is a population -based optimization technique where each particle represents a \\npossible solution within a search space. The \"best\" particles are selected based on their fitness or objective function \\nvalues. Here\\'s how the best particles are typically selected in a PSO algorithm:  \\n1. Initialization: In the beginning, a population of particles is created, and each particle is assigned a \\nrandom position within the problem\\'s search space. The fitness of each particle is evaluated based on the \\nobjective function to determine how well it performs with its current position.  \\n2. Personal Best (Pbest) Update: Each particle maintains its own \"personal best\" position and fitness value. \\nIf the current position of a particle results in a better fitness value than its previously recorded personal \\nbest, the particle updates its Pbest to the current position.  \\n3. Global Best (Gbest) Update: Among all the particles in the population, the one with the best fitness value \\nis considered the \"global best\" particle. This is typically based on the fitness value achieved by \\nevaluating the objective function at each particle\\'s position. The Gbest is updated whenever a particle in \\nthe population achieves a better fitness value than the current Gbest.  \\n4. Particle Movement: Based on the Pbest and Gbest information, each particle updates its velocity and \\nposition. This update is typically done using the PSO update equations, which are designed to guide the \\nparticles toward better solutions.  \\n5. Repeat: Steps 2 -4 are repeated for a specified number of iterations or until a termination criterion is met.  \\n6.

Conclusion  \\nIn the dynamic and ever -evolving domain of microblogging platforms, sentiment analysis stands as a critical tool \\nfor extracting insights from the vast sea of user -generated content. This research has made significant strides in \\nadvancing sentiment analysis, particularly in the context of Twitter data. Leveraging innovative methodologies, this \\nstudy has addressed the complex challenges associated with analyzing Twitter content, and its findings have far -\\nreaching implications. The key contributions of this research include a novel approach that employs tweet \\nsubjectivity to selectively acquire training samples and the introduction of the Effective Word Score (EFWS) \\nheuristic to enhance sentiment classification. The results are compelling, with accuracy levels consistently exceeding 85%, even with a training dataset that is only half the size of the baseline model. Furthermore, this improvement in accuracy has not come at the expense of speed, as the research has demonstrated a twofold increase in training efficiency. The integration of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has further elevated performance. This research has opened the door to several promising avenues for future exploration in the field of sentiment analysis. First, the integration of advanced techniques like transfer learning and deep ensemble approaches holds the potential to significantly boost the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis models. Second, the adoption of domain -specific pre -trained models, tailored to the intricacies of Twitter data, offers a \\ncompelling path to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy. A deeper investigation into the optimal utilization of hybrid features and their interplay with various classification algorithms can yield valuable insights for model refinement. Furthermore, the research could benefit from the incorporation of more sophisticated optimization algorithms, going beyond Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further streamline the model's performance. Exploring sentiment analysis in multilingual contexts and across emerging social media platforms presents a rich opportunity for extending the scope of this research. Lastly, given the complexity of modern sentiment analysis models, the \\nintegration of explainable AI techniques can play a crucial role in demystifying these models, fostering trust and \\ncomprehension in their predictions. These exciting avenues promise to push the boundaries of sentiment analysis and enrich its application in the ever -evolving landscape of microblogging platforms.  \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Introduction\\nPassengers’ thoughts on Twitter can be examined using senti-\\nment analysis. In a study, sentiment analysis is used to investigate\\npeople’s interests, assessments, and sentiments depends on what\\nthey wish to be written. Sentiment analysis is used as it has to deal\\nwith opinion, reality, and decisions that has to be taken. It is not\\nuncommon for people to seek out the opinions of others when\\nmaking decisions. Sentiment analysis is used in this study to look\\nat ideas of people who wrote on Twitter. The goal is to see how\\ncommuter line passengers react to the Covid-19 being transmitted.\\nThe twitter data was evaluated. Furthermore, the information\\ngathered was divided into three categories by IEEE 2020. This arti-\\ncle is available for download and available, as well as complete text\\nand data mining rights, as well as re-use and analysis rights for,\\nnamely Positive, Negative, and Neutral. After that, sentiment anal-\\nysis can be used to determine people’s true inﬂuence.\\nThe NLTK approach will be employed in this investigation. Sen-\\ntiment Analysis of Public Transportation on social media Using the\\nNLTK was the method chosen based on past research. This studyused sentiment analysis to evaluate public transit customers and\\ngot replies and feedback. Users’ responses and feedback are extre-\\nmely varied, and each has their own point of view. NLTK is used for\\nclassiﬁcation because it is an optimal method for classifying text,\\nand it was chosen to ease the difﬁculty of the material on internet,\\nwhich can be quite extensive. NLTK was also chosen based on the\\nresults of a survey on algorithms that would be employed in this\\nprocess. The output demonstrates that the NLTK is one of suitable\\nmethods for solving sentiment analysis challenges. Furthermore,\\nthe decision tree technique was considered above the others since\\nit gave superior accuracy. The decision tree is also more optimal to\\nutilize. Both methods are simple to use and produce accurate\\nresults. As a result, the nave Bayes method and the decision tree\\nwill be used in this study to discover which method produces\\nsuperior accuracy. In this study, the writing system contains that\\nsummarizes the study’s context and aims. The literature review\\nhighlights the hypotheses that have been to aid in the develop-\\nment of this study. The research procedure explains how the data\\nwas gathered. Various methodologies can be used to perform sen-\\ntiment categorization. We can categorize these approaches in sev-\\neral ways. in the three sorts that follow: 1) A lexicon-based\\nstrategy; 2) a machine learning/deep learning strategy, and 3) a\\nhybrid strategy .\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2022.04.809\\n2214-7853/Copyright /C2112022 Elsevier Ltd.

Related works\\nSentiment analysis is a technique for analyzing user’s thoughts,\\nfeelings, and judgments. According to some viewpoints, sentiment\\nanalysis is used to determine what users believe based on informa-\\ntion such as written opinions. The analysis was carried out on the\\nwritten opinion, according to the two opinions. People frequently\\nexpress and post their ideas on social media as a result of the dig-\\nital era’s development, which makes us unable to avoid it. When it\\ncomes to internet, Twitter is one of the most popular places for\\npeople to express themselves. This can be utilized as a data sourcefor analysis. Because of its prominence, Twitter was chosen as a\\nsource of opinion mining. A concise explanation of beliefs and per-\\nceptions up to 150 characters long on Twitter. This can be utilized\\nas information in sentiment analysis to generate information and\\ndetermine people’s true inﬂuence. Text mining, which is a way of\\nextracting important information from a material, was used in this\\nsentiment analysis study. Text mining is that entails document\\npreparation. Preprocessing transforms text from unstructured doc-\\numents into structured information. The structured information is\\nsubsequently classiﬁed using a data mining classiﬁcation approach\\n[1].\\nThe second study [2]used Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Ran-\\ndom Forest to analyze sentiment in social media. Positive, negative,\\nand neutral sentiments are categorized based on Twitter data. As a\\nresult, Indonesian Twitter users are more neutral in their views.\\nThe three methods with the highest accuracy were compared using\\ndata from fast miner tools. With an accuracy of 86.43 percent, Nave\\nBayes is more accurate than the other method. The Decision Tree\\nand Random Forest were both 82.91percent accurate.\\nThe third study [3]looked at classiﬁcation with the Naive Bayes\\nClassiﬁer and Decision Tree Algorithms. The Naive Bayes classiﬁca-\\ntion and decision tree method are suggested for this study as a\\nmore accurate and effective prediction in the assumption sort of\\nbrain tumor. The goal of this research is to show that the Decision\\nTree algorithm is more straightforward and straightforward than\\nthe Nave Bayes algorithm. The type of tumor has been identiﬁed\\nusing these two algorithms, and it allows for the examination of\\nhistorical data from data sets, allowing neurologists to make edu-\\ncated guesses about the type of tumor. The Decision Tree algorithm\\nis, without a doubt, faster and more accurate than the Naive Bayes\\nalgorithm. Furthermore, the fourth study uses Decision Tree, K-\\nNearest Neighbor, and Nave Bayes to analyze sentiment from\\ntweets. A tweet from e-commerce is used as a case study in thisstudy. Text mining, text preprocessing, categorization, and other\\napproaches are used in this study. These strategies are used to\\ndevelop sentiment analysis classiﬁcation and analysis. Rapid miner\\nis also utilized to aid in the comparison of analysis attitudes by uti-\\nlizing three different categories inside the dataset. According to the\\nﬁndings of this study [4,5] , the Nave Bayes algorithm has the max-\\nimum accuracy of 77 percent. The ﬁfth study compares Naive\\nBayes, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks in classiﬁcation. This\\nstudy categorizes web pages through a of the three algorithms.\\nAccording to the ﬁndings of this study [6], they improved Nave.\\nThe Bayes classiﬁer not only out performs the traditional Nave\\nclassiﬁer. Bayes, on the other hand, performs similarly well.\\nKhakharia et al [7], they have used Machine Learning to scan\\npublic tweets from Twitter connected to COVID-19 immunizations\\nin order to determine the user’s perspective on the vaccine (ML).\\nThe analysis of the Twitter data into positive or negative messages\\nwas done using three distinct machine learning algorithms such as\\nMultinomial Nave Bayes (MNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM),\\nand Logistic Regression (LR). The LR algorithm produced the best\\nresults in the analysis, with a 97.3 percent accuracy, while SVM\\nhad a 96.26 percent accuracy. In comparison to the other ML algo-rithms, the MNB had the lowest accuracy of 88 percent. Marcec\\nand Likic [8]introduced vaccination drive analysis using the Twit-\\nter based sentiment analysis. Here they have used social network-\\ning sites like Twitter might very well prove to be a useful medium\\nof communication on SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations feelings and beliefs\\nwhich can be observed nearly instantly.\\nAlam et al [9], they have used valence aware dictionary for sen-\\ntiment reasoned, a natural language processing (NLP) tool, was\\nused to assess people’s feelings towards certain vaccines (VADER).\\nThey were able to illustrate the entire scenario by grouping the\\nreceived attitudes into three categories (positive, negative, and\\nneutral). We found that 33.96 percent of the respondents were\\npositive, 17.55 percent were negative, and 48.49 percent were neu-\\ntral. Nezhad et al [10,11] , investigated Iranian people’s views on\\nCOVID-19 vaccinations by analyzing Iranian twitter posts. Discussthe various Iranian attitudes toward indigenous and imported\\nCOVID-19 vaccinations. They have used CNN-LSTM architecture,\\nwe determined emotions of recovered tweets. Furthermore, we\\nlooked into Iranian attitudes on the COVID-19 vaccine.\\nSamira et al [4], developed an analysis model based on the con-\\ntent of Twitter. They were able to determine popular attitude and\\nthoughts about the COVID-19 vaccinations. They have discoveredvaccination feelings and views in retweets after separation and\\nanalyzed their growth over time, geographical location, principal\\nthemes, hashtags, post analytics tools, as well as accounts features.\\nSuch tweets are collected from Twitter using a Twitter API authen-\\ntication token in this investigation. NLP is used to receive and ana-\\nlyze the raw twitter posts. A supervised KNN clustering algorithm\\nis then used to classify the produced data. The data is divided into\\nthree categories by the algorithm: positive, negative, and neutral.\\nThese categories pertain to the prevailing attitude of the persons\\nwhom Retweets are being analysed by Javed et al [12]. Ansari\\net al [13], they have analysed COVID-19 immunization retweets\\nto offer an assessment of the government’s sentiments to ongoing\\nimmunization drives. Investigations on sentiment classiﬁcation\\nwere also conducted in order to reveal new knowledge regarding\\nthe effects of location and gender including [3,14,15] .\\nAs a result of the best approach that can be taken is that the\\nNaive Bayes algorithm is used for selection for training web pages.\\n3. Proposed method\\nPanda’s library was used to turn the data-set into a data frame\\nfor the purposes of this paper, making data manipulation and anal-\\nysis easier. The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a computational\\nlinguistics package that provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50\\nlexical resources. This library was used for text pre-processing\\n(stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal), tokenization,\\nsentiment analysis (NLTK Sentiment Intensity Analyzer), and Emo-\\ntional Analysis (Lexicon based) in this article. Matplotlib is a data\\nvisualization package that may be used to create static, animated,\\nand interactive data visualizations. This library was used to plot\\ntime series graphs and donut chart for the purposes of this paper.\\nTokenization is the process of dividing a large chunk of text into\\nsmaller tokens. In this case, tokens can be words, characters, or sub\\nwords. I utilized NLTK’s treebank tokenizer to perform word level\\ntokenization on tweets in this project. Text Pre-processing cleans\\nthe text data and removes superﬂuous elements such as stop\\nwords, hashtags, and emoticons, among other things, so that the\\ntext is ready to be given to the model.\\nThese methods were used in this study. Because of the strong\\nassumptions and great accuracy, the Naive Bayes method is used.\\nThe Decision Tree method was chosen because it is more straight-\\nforward and straightforward to utilize. The following are the expla-\\nnations for the two methods:P. Chinnasamy, V. Suresh, K. Ramprathap et al.

Conclusion\\nIn recent months, there has been a growth in unfavorable opin-\\nion about both domestic and export vaccines in all over the globe,\\nwhich is concerning. Because health authorities want to improve\\nthe adoption of COVID-19 immunizations in order to stop the epi-demic, they might use sites such as twitter to spread good mes-\\nsages and reduce negative ones.\\nP.Chinnasamy, Writing the papers and responsible for\\nImplementation.\\nV.Suresh, Collection of DataSet.\\nK.Ramprathap - Proof Reading this article.\\nB Jency A Jebamani - Support for Plagiarism removal.\\nK.
