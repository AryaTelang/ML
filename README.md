# Machine Learning 

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented in Python using popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. 

Implementation of ML Basics:
1. Classification
2. Regression

Working with Large Language Models (LLMs):
1. PDF Query project: Using Gemini and FAISS Vector store,one can upload any pdfs to the Streamlit app and ask any questions in form of prompts with the PDF context.

2. RAG LLM: Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLama Index - LLM relies on the context of data given instead of the data it has been trained on. Not deployed on streamlit due to some issues with the deprecated transformer on HuggingFace.
